1. MANKINDS JƲBILEE.

    _ The firſt DISTINCTION.

    _ The ſecond Diſtinction declareth what the common ſalvation is, and the extent thereof for the benefit of all men, whereby is ſet forth in good part, the excellency of the reſtored ſecond life of mankinde, gratiouſly intended by Christ on Gods part, to preſerve all men from the eternall ſecond death.

    _ The third Distinction ſheweth, that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by a ſalvation firſt wrought by and in himſelfe alone, without men, laid the foundation of the common ſalvation of all men, by his deſcenſion from Heaven, and perſonall performances upon the earth.

    _ The fourth Diſtinction proveth, that one means to establiſh the common ſalvation purchaſed by himſelfe, is this: This Chriſt by his death, aboliſhed the eternall condemning power of the Morall Law for all men, yet briefly ſhewing the neceſſary uſe thereof.

    _ The fifth Diſtinction proveth alſo, that to perfect the foundation of the common ſalvation, Chriſt by his death hath aboliſhed the firſt death for all men.

    _ The ſixth Diſtinction ſheweth, that as Chriſt hath by the ſaid ſalvation firſt wrought in himſelfe, laid the foundation of the common ſalvation of all men, by his perſonall performances upon the earth without men; ſo herein is declared how he finiſheth the ſame by his ſpirit in all men, by his reſurrection and aſcenſion into Heaven, and by his their being.

    _ The ſeventh Distinction ſetteth forth, that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt perfects the common ſalvation even to all the Heathens alſo, where neither written Law nor Goſpell is vouchſafed unto them, otherwiſe then the effects thereof are written in their hearts.

    _ The eighth Diſtinction, which ſheweth the miſtakes of ſome men, concerning divers very conſiderable expreſſions of Scripture, which hath bred, and doth nurſe up many vaine contentions, even amongſt Chriſtians, about the gratious extent of the common ſalvation.

    _ The ninth Diſtinction doth d ſcover what thoſe ſins were, which are accounted in Scripture, to have been the ſinnes againſt the Father, and that thoſe ſinnes alſo, were the ſame ſins, which in Scripture are called the ſinnes of the whole world, and that they are all forgiven in and by Chriſt.

    _ The tenth Diſtinction, wherein is ſet forth, what thoſe ſins are, which in Scripture are accounted to be the ſins againſt the Sonne, or Son of man, and that they alſo, as in reference to eternall puniſhment, ſhall verily be forgiven to the ſonnes of men.

    _ The eleventh Diſtinction ſheweth what thoſe ſins are, which in Scripture are accounted to be ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghost, and that they ſhall never be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come, and the cauſe why, whereby the ſecond death is diſcovered alſo.

    _ The twelth Diſtinction, wherein the wrong application of the ſimile of the Potter and his clay is diſcovered.

    _ The thirteenth Distinction, wherein the miſtakes of ſome men, concerning Gods dealing with Jacob and Eſau, is laid open.

    _ The fourteenth Distinction, wherein ſome mens miſconſtructions, are diſcovered concerning that Text, where it is ſaid, So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy, Rom. 9.16.

    _ The fifteenth Diſtinction, wherein the miſtake is diſcovered, which ſome men have faſtned on that Text, where it is ſaid, Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth, Rom. 9.18. and alſo ſheweth, that there is but one will in God.

    _ The ſixteenth Diſtinction ſheweth the unwarranted dealings of ſome men, with Gods prerogative, by a wreſted application of Gods hardning Pharaohs heart.

    _ The ſeventeenth Diſtinction is, to rectifie ſome mens miſtakes of that Text, where it is ſaid, For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate, Rom. 8.29. and of that Text, where it is ſaid, elect according to the fore-knowledge of God, 1 Pet. 1.2.

    _ The eighteenth Diſtinction is a ſhort application of theſe laſt ſix Diſtinctions, for further clearing the cauſe of election and reprobation.

    _ The nineteenth Diſtinction is briefly to ſhew, what the ſpeciall ſalvation is, mentioned in 1 Tim. 4.10. as distinct from the common ſalvation, which is in that Text therewith coupled.

    _ The twentieth Diſtinction ſheweth, that as all men loſt their peace with God (by Adams fall) which all Adams poſterity had by propriety in him, whileſt be stood, ſo all men are vertually in Chriſt, and by Chriſt, reconciled to God againe by reſtoration, though ſome men after their inlightenment, abuſe that grace of their reconciliation in him, and do thereby loſe the benefit thereof.

    _ The one and twentieth Diſtinction proveth; that whereas all men were involved under the curſe of the Law, by the deſtrucvtive firſt Adams fall, ſo all men are againe bleſſed virtually in Chriſt, the reſtoring ſecond Adam, though ſome men will, after inlightenment, voluntarily loſe the eternall benefit of that bleſſedneſſe.

    _ The two and twentieth Diſtinction ſheweth, that all men are by reſtoration ſanctified in Chriſt vertually, though ſome men doe abuſe the ſame, and ſo wilfully loſe the benefit of that their Sanctification.

    _ The three and twentieth Diſtinction declareth, that all men by reſtoration, are juſtified in Chriſt vertually from the curſe of the Law, and firſt death, though no man is by imputation perſonally justified, untill he be a confiding beleever.

    _ The twenty fourth Distinction, wherein is proved by plaine Texts of Scripture, that as all men by Adams fall, were blotted out of Gods book of life, that came in with the Creation; ſo all men are in and by Chriſt and his performances alone, againe written in the book of life, that came into the world by Chriſts reſtoration, and that no one man hath been, is, or ſhall be blotted out thereof, but by his owne perſonall default, ſhewing alſo herein, the fundamentall eauſe of the hereticall errour of the Papiſts doctrine, hinting herein; alſo what the Lambs booke of life is.

    _ Obſervations conſiderable, appertaining to the former diſcourſe.
