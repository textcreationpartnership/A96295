            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>MANKIND'S JUBILEE: OR, Good Tidings of great Joy for all people, plainly diſcovered by Scripture Texts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And the Angel ſaid unto them, Fear not: For behold, I bring you good Tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all People, For unto you is borne this day in the City of</hi> David <hi>a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord,</hi> Luke 2.10, 11. <hi>And this famous general proclamation of Grace for all People, was alſo then publiſhed by a multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt.</hi> ver. 13.</p>
            <p>Thus Chriſt was from Heaven declared to be the Saviour of all Men, or all People, agreeable to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. (who accordingly) hath redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, by his being made a Curſe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. By his taſting death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. wherby he became the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p>Shewing, That there is a Common Salvation of all Men, from the Eternity of the Curſe of the Law, and firſt death, and that in that ſalvation, ſuch reall Ability is communicated through our Saviour Chriſt his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances to all men, as that no one man hath done, doth, or ſhall eternally periſh, by any obſtructions which came over all men, by <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, but onely by his own actuall and wilfull perſiſting in the abuſe of the Ability by grace in Chriſt conferred unto him.</p>

               <hi>The</hi> INTROD<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CTION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as it is evident, that ſome men, even Chriſtian men, yea even ſome godly learned men, by caſting in their owne ſcholaſticall gloſſes, upon many excellent plain Texts of Scripture, have as much as in them lyeth, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed the comfortable uſe of the firm foundation, on which faith and repentance, ought in Gods ordinary way pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to be builded, even the common ſalvation mentioned <hi>Jude 3.</hi> which the Scripture, if it be permitted to ſpeak for it ſelfe, in its owne litterall language, with the aſſistance of the ſpirit thereon attending, being ſubmitted unto, will of its ſelfe evidently ſet forth to publick view.</p>
            <p>From the vanity of which practice, men are neceſſitated, being thereby caſt into confuſed conceptions and concluſions ariſing from various humane expoſitions, to propound theſe and ſuch like queſtions, how it can be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed, that Chriſt is the Saviour of all men? according to <hi>1</hi> Tim. <hi>4.10</hi> except all men be eternally ſaved? or by whoſe means it comes to paſſe, that although Chriſt taſted death for every man, according to <hi>Heb. 2.9.</hi> and dyed for (no fewer than) all, <hi>2 Cor. 5.15.</hi> that yet ſome men do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in an eternall death? How that although our Saviour Chriſt, be by his death the propitiation for (no fewer ſinnes than) the ſins of the whole world, according to <hi>1</hi> John <hi>2.2.</hi> that yet ſome men doe periſh eternally, in, and by their ſinnes? How Christ can be truly ſaid to be (not only tidings, but) good tidings (not only of joy, but alſo) of great joy (not only to ſome, but alſo) to all people, according to <hi>Luke 2.10, 11.</hi> when as notwithſtanding ſome people doe periſh in eternall ſorrow?</p>
            <p>Theſe men thereby, though it may be unawares, do intimately charge God to reſerve dubious ment all reſervations in himſelfe.</p>
            <p>In anſwer whereto, that I may procure aright underſtanding, ſeparate from theſe, and ſuch like fancied doubts, let it not be tedious I intreat you, to take notice, that in <hi>Rev. 2.11. and 20.6. and 21.8.</hi> being compared with <hi>Rev. 20.10, 15. and</hi> Mat. <hi>25.41, 46.</hi> there is an expreſſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of an eternall ſecond death, into which men may fall; which ſecond death, doth unavoidably intimate, the extinguiſhing of a preceding firſt death, into which all men without Chriſt conſidered, ſhould have fallen into,
<pb facs="tcp:152477:3"/>as is further proved in this tract; which firſt death and ſecond death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered of together, doe fairely preſent to our apprehenſion, a firſt life, which was once incident to men, and relatively foregoing a firſt death, and alſo a ſecond life procured by Chriſt's performances only, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſheth the firſt death, and is alſo relatively foregoing the ſecond death before mentioned; for without a foregoing firſt life, there can be no firſt death, nor without a foregoing ſecond life, there can be no ſecond death.</p>
            <p>But for aready diſcovery herein, the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> inferreth, that the firſt l fe and firſt death, and the ſecond life and the ſecond death, either hath, doth, or may prove incident to ſome one and the ſame man; the firſt life by Creation, and the reſtored ſecond l fe by Chriſt being conſidered of; for he affirmeth, that ſome perſons by their turning the grace of God into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jude 4.</hi> (that deny the Lord that bought them, <hi>2 Pet. 2.1.</hi>) from the eternall danger of the firſt death, as is proved he hath done for all men, in my <hi>5</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. Theſe men ſaith <hi>Jude,</hi> are twice dead, and then alſo plucked up by the roots, to whom is reſerved the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever. Note this, not only once dead, but twice dead, and then alſo plucked up by the roots: that is to ſay, Firſt, once alive by grace of Creation: then Secondly, dead by <hi>Adams</hi> fall: Thirdly, alive againe by Chriſts reconciliation made: and Fourthly, dead againe the ſecond time, by their wilfull perſonall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the abuſe of grace, after their inlightenment; and then, and not while then, plucked up by the roots.</p>
            <p>Now beloved by my ſhewing that by the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> offence, the firſt life by Creation was loſt for all men, and that death, even the firſt death thereby piſſed upon all men; and by my proving that our Saviour Chriſt, the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſecond <hi>Adam, Acts 3.21.</hi> doth eſtate by his performances, all men, by a reall common ſalvation, into are ſtored ſecond life, which doth extinguiſh the aforeſaid firſt death for all men, and that therein, and thereby, Chriſt doth confer ſuch effectuall light, freedome, and ability in due ſeaſon upon all men in their inward man, mind and will, ſo that in their well uſage thereof they might eſcape the ſecond death alſo, and by my having proved what the ſecond death is, and the cauſe why it is executed upon any man. I ſhall thereby make it appear clearly, in full anſwer to the former queries, and ſuch like, that it is not from God, but by ſome mens wilfull perſonall defaults brought about, that ſome men doe periſh by their own perſonall acting and perſiſting after inlightenment, in diſobedience againſt the ſecond Covenant, which is of grace, by their reſiſting the gratious dictates of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <head type="sub">Three directions according to three ſeverall conditions of men.</head>
            <p>FIrſt, to all ſuch men, who though being by our Saviour Chriſt in due ſeaſon, inabled to know the truth, and confide in Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only, and faithfully to indeavour to walk anſwerably, as is proved that al men are in my 6 and 7 Diſtinct. yet do prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if not blaſphemouſly, not only ſlight Gods grace but alſo in effect do charge God with diſabling them by a decreed preterition, deluſively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that thereby they cannot repent, and that they cannot beleeve. Theſe men I do exhort to conſider, that no rationall man, except he be juſtly given up of God to a reprobate mind dare affirme, but that God hath, at ſeverall times, ſtrived with his conſcience, to convince him of his evill requitall of his gratious favours. Neither dare they ſay, that God hath not alſo all along in their own experience, afforded them not only meanes, but alſo much more ability to be humbly obedient to the faith, then they ever did, or were willing to act in accordingly.</p>
            <p>Theſe men, as I doe hereby perſwade them to take notice of the large extention of freedome and ability, which God by grace commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates to every man, as is declared in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after following, to take away that conceit of their fallacious ſheltring cannots, and to cauſe them to confeſſe to the glory of God, and their own ſhame that the fault is in themſelves that will not repent, that wil not beleeve, that will not be obedient. So alſo I do perſwade thoſe men, if they come to bee reſolvedly willing to become obedient to Gods convincement, then to take heed of building their faith, upon the fading ſands of their legall reformations.</p>
            <p>For firſt, the Scripture ſets forth all men, being conſidered of as meerly naturall, to be Atheiſts, <hi>the wiſdome of this world, is fooliſhneſſe with God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. From hence it is ſaid, <hi>the fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no Gods, Pſal.</hi> 14.1. that being all mens prime condition after the fall. And from thence it is affirmed, that he that will come to God, muſt beleeve that God is, <hi>H b.</hi> 11.6. with theſe men, whileſt they ſo continue they are without God in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. God is not in all their thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. which is a terrible fearfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152477:4"/>
            <p> And Secondly, when men are convinced by Gods ſpirit of their trnaſgreſſions, then thereby their atheiſme vaniſheth away, and then they do moſt ordinarily earneſtly preſſe into Popery, to pleaſe God, whom they have ſo offended by making him a mens in their future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation by their doing and walking in any ſort of ſuperſtition practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the world, rather than by faith to depend upon Gods grace and goodneſſe only purchaſed by Chriſt, which alwaies procures thankfull obedient walking; and though ſome men are without their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or ſeeking, nay it may be contrary to their deſire, by a nationall Law, ſet free from the outward fantaſticall traſh of Popiſh Diſcipline, and out ward doctrine of their ſuppoſed meritorious obſervations, and are thereby conſtrained to be Proteſtants in conceit, yet they doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inwardly though ſecretly, the papiſticall, hereticall opinion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or juſtification by works, or at beſt by faith and works mixed in the very fundamentall. And although ſome others by the means aforeſaid, called Proteſtants, verbally confeſſe, that they ought not, nor cannot conclude their being perſonally juſtified before God by their works, yet alſo they will affirm as ſome of them have done, that by their works of ſigns or ſuppoſed reformations they may fundamentally know and conclude that they ſhall be juſtified by Chriſt, their faith in God, being by this fancied tenent, more ſtrong or more weak, according as their ſuppoſed reformations, are more lively or dead, in their actuall perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: and although good actions are chearſully to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in; yet to have faith ſtrong or weak in the fund amentall, according to their variation is a more ſecret deceit of Popery and therefore more dangerous to be convinced of. Thoſe ſeeming Proteſtants though they be transformed from the firſt condition of Atheiſts, into the eſtate of Papiſts either in externall profeſſion, or internall confidence, are ſtill void of the fundamentall, to confide only in Gods meer mercy, grace and goodneſſe purchaſed by Chriſt, and upon that fundamentall ground to walke humbly, obediently and thankfully before God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond direction is to ſuch men, as have ſo far yielded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincement, that in their obedience to the faith, they have forſaken all legall confidences, as fundamentall (and are become earneſt ſeekers to find out the good old way, to finde reſt to their ſoules) that they doe not provoke God by their immoderate diſtruſtfull importunacy, by their not being in the firſt place, contented to be of thoſe, who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by faith, but alſo by patience thereto annexed, do attain to inherit
<pb facs="tcp:152477:4"/>the promiſes, according to that exhortation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.12. but will at all adventures, raſhly poſt over the expreſſions of the common ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Gods gratious generall promiſes, declared therefrom in his written word to ſinners and to the ungodly, if turning to his grace, not excepting one man: Which written word the Apoſtle affirmeth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is the ſure word of peophecie, unto which men ought waitingly to take heed, untill the day dawn (and Chriſt the bright morning ſtar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16.) or the day ſtar ariſe in their hearts, as is fully proved 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. but will by that their diſtruſting raſhneſſe, aſpiringly deſire, that the day ſtar ſhould ariſe in their hearts firſt, even before they have patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walked to, and before God in honouring him, by conſenting to, and making uſe of his abundant mercy and goodneſſe, declared by him in generall expreſſions for all men in his written word, which inordinate diſtruſtfull haſt, is reproved of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth, ſhall not make haſt, Iſa.</hi> 26.18. and ſo much the rather I doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thoſe ſo convinced ones, though not to abate their importuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet to mix confiding, waiting; and depending patience therewith. Becauſe experience hath often preſented to our view, that diversper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by their exerciſing ſuch diſtruſtfull raſh importunacy, and yet fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their end by them ſo ſought for; that is, by an immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to aſcertaine them of their eternall life, which being not then granted, they have caſt themſelves headlong into a deſperate dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and untimely death.</p>
            <p>The third exhortation, I humbly preſent to all ſuch perſons who have confidingly, and perſiſtingly abided by faith, in the comfortable uſe of Gods generall gratious promiſes, ſo far in all difficulties and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that God having ſrownd, theſe abiding beleevers perſiſtingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in humble obedience to the faith, and in faithfull indeavours in their thankfull walking hath eſtabliſhed them in the benefits of the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſalvation, ſealing them after they beleeved, with his holy ſpirit of promiſe, according to <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. Theſe bleſſed people I do humbly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that now having their firſt nurſe in the faith, the common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more clearly unmasked unto them in this tract; from whoſe breaſts though they now ſlight her, yet in the infancy of their faith, they firſt ſucked the ſtreams of eternall life, that now they will be pleaſed to own their firſt nurſe whileſt they were in the cradle concerning faith, for the comfortable building and nurſing up of Gods Church now comming in, or hereafter to come in, that by the diſcovery of the large extent of his
<pb facs="tcp:152477:5"/>love to, and care over all men, he may come to be more and more admired in his ſaints, deſiring thoſe bleſſed people, no longer to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to deprive the world, of the moſt ſure moſt ready and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable foundation of faith and patience, and repentance, preſented frequently in Gods written word in generall promiſes, on his part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the benefit of all men. And that thoſe Saints of God will be pleaſed (what ever other ignorant people doe) no longer with dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous interpretations to diſcourage, but with Scriptures plaine and full ſayings, to direct infants in the faith; firſt, to feed upon that generall milke of the word, and not to forſake their importunacy, to ask, and ſeek, and knock, but yet with patience, to wait upon the lively uſe of Gods generall promiſes, untill the day-ſtar do ariſe in thoſe tender wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hearts, as formerly it did in their own, when they reſolvedly with patience, waited for eſtabliſhment. Thus intreating thee to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that I do not by this inſuing tract maintaine, that any one man hath free will, as he is deſcended from fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> to incline to, or to think, much leſſe to act any thing acceptable to God, in point of eternall ſalvation, but that hereby I do by Scripture prove the contrary.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that I do not herein maintain, that all men are eternally ſaved, but that ſome men after their inlightenment, and infranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the common ſalvation in due ſeaſon, wil wilfully refuſe their own mercies, chooſe their own deſtruction, and will draw back even to eternall perdition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that I do not in this enſuing tract maintaine, that any one man, though found beleevingly well acting in the ability by grace given unto him in the common ſalvation, can in the leaſt meaſure, merit or deſerve reward of due debt from God, otherwiſe them God is pleaſed by the mercy of his own ſecond Covenant, to impute righteouſneſſe unto him, as is largely proved in my 14 Diſtinction. Thus alſo deſiring thee to read and conclude without partiality, I reſt thine in the Lord Jeſus.</p>

               <item>The twentieth Diſtinction ſheweth, that as all men loſt their peace with God by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, which all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity had by propriety in him, whileſt he ſtood; ſo all men are virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in Chriſt by Chriſt, reconciled to God againe by reſtoration, though ſome men after their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightenment, doe abuſe that grace of their reconciliation in him, and doe thereby loſe the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thereof. <hi>p. 86</hi>
               </item>
               <item>The one and twentieth Diſtinction proveth, that whereas all men were involved under the curſe of the Law, by the deſtructive firſt <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ſo all men are againe bleſſed virtual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt, the reſtoring ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> though ſome men will after inlightenment, voluntarily loſe the eternall benefit of that bleſſendeſſe. <hi>p. 89</hi>

               </item>
               <item>The twenty fourth Diſtinction, wherein is proved by plaine Texts of Scripture, that as all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall were blotted out of Gods book of life, that came in with the Creation, ſo all men are in and by Chriſt and his performances only, againe written in the book of life, that came into the world by Chriſts reſtoration; and that no one man hath been, is, or ſhall be blotted out thereof, but by his owne perſonall default, ſhewing alſo herein, the fundamentall cauſe of the hereticall error of the Papiſts doctrine, hinting herein alſo what the Lambs book of life is. <hi>p. 101</hi>

               <head type="sub">The firſt Diſtinction which ſheweth (that as all men loſt their bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed firſt Life of Creation by the Fall, and thereby fell all of them into the firſt death) that there is a common ſalvation wrought by Chriſt, warranted by Scripture, which doth relieve all men from the eternall danger of the firſt death, and from that impaſsibility to be ternally ſaved, which came in by <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, ſhewing alſo the difference be wixt the Old man, and New man, and Rationall man.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow herein I doe humbly beſeech you, that you will not undervalue, extenuate, nor deface the fulneſſe of the litteral ſence, expreſſed in divers places of Scripture by the Holy Ghoſt, in its ſpeaking of Chriſts performances on his part intended, for the eternall ſalvation of all men, as theſe following and the like.</p>
               <p>That as God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that (no fewer than all) ſhould come to repentance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. That even ſo accordingly, becauſe all men are caſt into unability to know the truth (by the fall) therefore God will have all men ſaved, and come unto the the knowledge of the truth. Note that it is not here
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152477:7"/>ſaid, that God deſires it only, or would have it ſo, or that he will have but ſome men ſaved; but abſolutely God will have (no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than) all men ſaved and come unto the knowledge of the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. And againe it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>who gave himſelfe a ranſome for all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Herein Chriſts obedience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that expreſſe will of his Father, appeareth to be by Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, a Saviour for no fewer than all men. Alſo it is ſaid <hi>that by the Grace of God he ſhould taſte death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. Here is the fundamentall means of effecting that abſolute gratious will of God ſet forth to be for no leſſe number than all men. Alſo a believer hath teſtified unto beleevers in the word, ſaying, <hi>And he is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for our ſins only, but alſo for the ſins of the whol world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. By this the extent of Chriſts being a propitiation by his taſting death for every man, is diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to take full effect with God for the ſins that were againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. for no fewer than the ſins of the whole world (or every man) Alſo it is ſaid, that God had purpoſed in himſelfe, that in the diſpenſation of the fulneſſe of time, to gather together in one (not only all men, but) all things in Chriſt, whether they be things in Heaven, or things on Earth, even in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. And to ſhew that this was a reconciled gathering together of all men in Chriſt, it is ſaid, <hi>that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes to them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20, <hi>but he laid upon him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. And yet further, plainly to ſhew that this reconcilſiation was not made onely for the world of the elect, as ſome have vainly fained. It is further affirmed, that <hi>it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, and having made peace by the blood of his Croſſe, by him to reconcile</hi> (not only all men, they being his choice earthly thing by Creation, but alſo) <hi>by him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all things to himſelfe:</hi> By him I ſay, <hi>whether they be things in Heaven, or things on earth, Col.</hi> 1.19, 20. Thus you ſee God in the attribute of his Juſtice and Truth, reconciled to all men in Chriſt by free mercy; and from this generall mercy of God in Chriſt towards all men in a common ſalvation, that famous diſcovery of the Angell, was publikely proclaimed, and unanimouſly conſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a multitude of the Heavenly Hoſt, ſaying, with a remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152477:7"/>
                  <hi>ecce, Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people, that this day is born unto you in the City of David, a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord, on earth peace, good will towards men, Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. herein not excepting any one man. Thus is Chriſt proclaimed to be a Saviour for no fewer than all people or all men.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> in his diligent courſe to maintain that ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which he expreſly calleth the common ſalvation, exhorteth that we ſhould earneſtly contend for the faith that was once given to the Saints, which appears to be given to thoſe Saints, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> which was by promiſe often repeated to them, that in their ſeed ſhould (no fewer then) all the Nations and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the Earth be bleſſed, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18. and 26.4. and 28.14. without excepting any one man; and accordingly <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo highly eſteem of <hi>I it us</hi> in this reſpect, that he called him his owne ſonne after the common faith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.4. And accordingly further teached him, <hi>that the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation unto all men hath appeared, Tit.</hi> 2.11. And all this generall mercy extended as in <hi>Romans</hi> 5. by the free gifts comming upon (no fewer than) all men unto Juſtification of Life; or as I finde it in a reformed Bible, in the ſame Chapter, thus, <hi>that as by the ſinne of one, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation came on all men; even ſo by the juſtifying of one, commeth the righteouſneſſe that bringeth life upon all men:</hi> by which means as is inferred in the ſame Chapter, as ſinne abounded by the Law, (there) grace did much more abound, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is there given to be this; <hi>that as ſin had raigned unto death</hi> (even over all men, as appears, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.) <hi>by the Law,</hi> ver. 20. <hi>even ſo</hi> (largely) <hi>might Grace reigne through righteouſneſſe by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord</hi> ver. 21. by his coſtly eſtabliſhing the Goſpell, intended on Gods part for the benefit of all men.</p>
               <p>And to ſay as the truth is, the Apoſtles very frequently in their Epiſtles, doe lay downe in plain words, theſe and ſuch like gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall grounds of a common ſalvation, wherefrom they do very often frame their following diſcourſes; though indeed this their generall ground-plot, though being declared by them the Apoſtles, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Prophets, and alſo our Saviour Chriſts own plain words, hath been by many Godly and Learned men, overlooked; which overſight hath not only as it were buried the moſt ready, the moſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152477:8"/>ſure, and moſt comfortable foundation of faith and repentance which is, that Chriſt dyed for all, and hath thereby ſaved them, from the curſe of the Law, and firſt death, bringing all men to the knowledge of truth, inabling all men; ſo that in their good uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they might alſo of ape the danger of the ſecond death, all which is herein proved, but alſo it hath bred and nurſed up, and doth nouriſh many variable noiſome contentions, even in the Chriſtian world by men; blaſting as much as in them lies, thoſe plain words, <hi>that Chriſt is the Saviour of all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>that he dyed for all</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>that he is the propitiation for the ſins of</hi> (no fewer than) <hi>the ſins of the whole world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p>But hereto I doe intreat you to take notice, that whereas in Scripture is mention made of the <hi>Oldman, Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9. and of the <hi>New man, Eph.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. that the common ſalvation is in no for heſpefull either to the <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New</hi> man, nor indeed can be, for the <hi>Old man is the body of ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.6. the old man is corrupt through deceiveable luſts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. This corrupt qualification in man is deviliſh, and from the Devill iſſueth naturaily into all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and is nouriſhed by Sathans continuall operations, thereto annexed, and cannot, nor is, in any mannar capable to receive any benefit, or be any waies bettered by the common ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And on the other de, the <hi>New man is renewed in knowledge, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Image of him that Created him, Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>and after God is crected in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe, Eph.</hi> 4.24. And by its thus proceeding from God, who is perfect perfection, it no way needeth, neither can it any waies be helped mended, or made better by the common ſalvation, or any other meanes. Therefore we are to know that the common ſalvation is by grace in Chriſt eſtabliſhed, and by him perfected for all men, whether any man doe beleeve it or not; that by the help of the holy and good ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall New man the Rationall man conſiſting (by vertue of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) of the ſubſtances of ſoule and body, might be aſſiſted on Gods part, againſt the continuall evill attempts and ſuggeſtions of the Sathanically deluding Old man; for both the New man and the Old man, do ſtrive againſt each other in the perſon of the Rationall mean to obtaine his conſent; either to good by the New mans ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152477:8"/>or to evill by the Old mans inſtigation. From whence the Apoſtle exhorts, not the ſpirituall new man that needeth no exhortation to good, nor the diabolicall Old man, that cannot poſſibly act any otherwiſe but to do evill; but he perſwades the Rationall man (in whoſe perſon they both do ſtrive to get the ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy in his acceptation and affection) <hi>to put off the Old man which is corrupt, and to put on the New man, which is after God created in righteouſneſſe, Eph.</hi> 4.22, 24. And from hence alſo the Apoſtle accounteth our <hi>yielding up our bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, our reaſonable</hi> or rationall <hi>ſervice, Rom.</hi> 12.1. Which Rationall man, or ſubſtances of body and ſoule being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of (without the ſinne by themſelves contracted to and in them) are in themſelves good for ſinne doth not null thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſubſtances, which were by Creation good, but doth pollute them.</p>
               <p>And not only the good ſubſtances of men, as in reference to the Creation, but of the Devils alſo are not offenſive, being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of apart from the ſinne thereto by themſelves contracted. And further to confirme this neceſſary point. Note what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>But I ſee another law in my members, rebelling againſt the law of my mind, Rom.</hi> 7.22. Herein the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth diſtinctly, that the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man is the ſpectator, and is the place or perſon in whom that combate is fought, for in effect he ſaith I ſee Note that I the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall man do ſee the conteſt betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, or the Old man and the New man making war one againſt the other in me, one of them in my mind the other in my members. Againe he ſaith, the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, ſo that ye cannot doe that ye would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the word (yee) cannot doe the things that (yee) would becauſe of the ſtrong conteſt of the Old man againſt the New man or the fleſh againſt the ſpirit maintained in their perſons, ſets ſorth the Rationall man diſtinct from the Old and New man, which ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, hath reference to <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. before cited.</p>
               <p>And although this combate of the fleſh and the ſpirit or the Old man and New man, be very often in the conſcience of every man that hath attained to years of underſtanding and judgement; yet this diſtinction is either not knowne, or but little diſcerned by any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152477:9"/>untill he become a confiding believer, neither doe any yield to the new mans part, but ſuch; yet I believe that no man being capable of underſtanding will deny, but that he hath often felt ſuch conflicts in his conſcience, and in his judgement, although he hath perſiſted in reſiſting the good motions of the holy ſpirit, and hath not followed, much leſſe accepted of that Goſpell-light; and ſo in time it may be his conſcience is grown ſeared, and then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up of God; ſpiritually inſenſible of all accuſations or good inſtructions of the ſpirit or New man dictated in his conſcience; therefore we are to underſtand, that by the rationall man, is meant every man, or the ſubſtances of every mans ſoule and body, and their faculties: And that every man thus conſidered, is totally by nature corrupt by <hi>Adams</hi> fall originally, and ſo is Sathanically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded and captived, in darkneſſe and rebellious diſpoſitions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2, 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.10, 18. So that before any one of mankind can attaine to be able to know or chooſe light or life, upon neceſſity he the rationall man muſt be inabled and ſet free by grace in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, their hearts, eies, and eares muſt be opened, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. <hi>Job</hi> 36.11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.8. For which end God gratiouſly hath perfected in and by our Saviour Chriſts performances only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalvation, whereby the naturally inchanted and deluded judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all men occaſioned by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, are ſet ſo free in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man in due ſeaſon, as that they may thereby if they make good uſe thereof, chooſe light and life, as is proved in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>And if any man do imagine, that the ſalvation of all men, this cauſe of great joy for all people, the bleſſings appropriated by and in him, <hi>Abrahams</hi> feed, to all Nations, and all the Families of the Earth are intended to be of God, but as temporall bleſſings to ſome part of men to be injoied by them in this life only; then ſee the miſery that inevitably fals to thoſe men thereby; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If in this life onely we have hope in Chriſt, then we are</hi> (not only of ſome men, but) <hi>of all men</hi> (not only miſerable, but) <hi>moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. So that in that ſence, thoſe temporall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings intended to ſome part of men, are extended forth only to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their eternall woe and miſery, which once the Scripture cryeth down, and affirmeth that God is good (not only to ſome,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152477:9"/>but) to all, and that (not only his mercies, but) his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over (not only ſome, but) over all his works. Thus farre that there is a common ſalvation perfected by and in Chriſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Gods part to procure the eternall ſalvation of all men, if they perſiſt not in reſiſting the operations of the Holy Ghoſt, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly tendred therein to every man.</p>

               <head>The ſecond Diſtinction declareth what the common ſalvation is, and the extent thereof for the benefit of all men, whereby is ſet forth in good part, the excellency of the reſtored ſecond life of mankinde, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly intended by Christ on Gods part, to preſerve all men from the eternall ſecond death.</head>
               <p>WEE are to effect this diſcovery, feriouſly to treaſure up in our memories, what in Scripture is fet forth to be a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall loſſe or common inbondagement that befell all men, by the deſtructive <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and we ſhall finde that one extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary great and common loſſe which befell all men thereby, was ſuch, that as conſidered in its own nature, it did utterly deprive all mankinde for ever, of that eſtate of poſſibility to be eternally ſaved, which <hi>Adam</hi> had given unto him by grace of Creation in himſelfe, or in his own power as the publick truſt for all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and though by no conſtraint of God, as is cleared, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.29. yet by his own perverſe behaviour againſt his faithfull Creator, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his gratious hand working, by his finding fault with his good condition then given him, he in effect rebelliouſly faying, <hi>Why haſt thou made me thus, that I muſt depend on thee, and not ſubſiſt upon, or by mine owne inventious.</hi> So marring himſelfe under his gratious Creatours hands, as is inſtanced, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.20. Thus by his forſaking of Godſirſt, he himſelfe wilfully loſt the freedome of will poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ability in himſelfe, to continue in his injoyment of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed uſe, of which he was poſſeſt by Creation, by which one loſſe was then loſt all the unexpreſſible bleſſings thereto belonging: And alſo he then and thereby loſt the reall poſſibility, which all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity had by propriety in him whilſt he ſtood to injoy all thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152477:10"/>bleſſings. Yet notwithſtanding, I beſeeth you further to note, that he loſt thereby no more for himſelfe and his poſterity, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the point in hand, but only a poſſibility to be eternally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for more than a poſſibility to be eternally ſaved, he could not loſe, neither for himſelfe, nor any one of his poſterity; for he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe though being the great and publick patterne for mankinde, in whom God did ſet forth the extent of his gratious intentions to all men, as concerning the Creations yet even he was thereby poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of no more, nor of any firmer eſtabliſhed Condition in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, than a poſſibility only, that he might be eternally ſaved; for in reference to this cauſe, by the utmoſt extent of his eſtate which was given him by Creation; as you know it was poſſible that by his well acting in that freedome of his will, he might have been eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaved: So alſo you know on the contrary part, that he by his evill acting in that his freedome of his will, he might loſe that his bleſſed eſtate for ever, which he hath done, and by his fall did unavoidably overwhelme all mankinde in an utter impoſſibility as of themſelves to be eternally ſaved.</p>
               <p>Note therefore that Chriſt the reſtoring Second <hi>Adam,</hi> by virtue of a ſalvation firſt wrought by his Death, Reſurrection and Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in himſelfe, for all men to make way for his gratious operating by his ſpirit in all men, as is proved he doth, in may 6 and 7 Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by that means helping all mankind out of that impoſſibility as of themſelves to be eternally ſaved, ſo as that all mankinde ſhall in due ſeaſon, injoy by free grace in their owne particular perſonall poſſeſſions, a reſtored ability, where by in their well uſing of that ability to them by the ſpirit communicated, by beleeving they might obtaine eternall life, and all the unutterable priviledges, mercy and bleſſings thereto belonging. This is the common ſalvation of all men, and is an effectuall ſalvation of all men from their impoſibility, in which they were all involved by <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
               <p>Although men may, and ſome men doe, by their wilfull abuſe of that their reſtored freedome and ability by grace given them, of themſelves <hi>Adam</hi>-like, <hi>forſake their owne mercies, Jonah</hi> 2.8. <hi>of themſelves chooſe their owne deſtructions, Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>of themſelves draw back to perdition, Heb.</hi> 10.39. and ſo of themſelves by their owne particular perſonall choiſe, refuſe, and ſo for ever loſe eternall life.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:152477:10"/>
               <p> Now to make it appeare viſibly by Holy writ, that our Saviour Chriſt his reſtoration of free do me and ability to all men in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalvation (where by they might or may in their well uſage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, attaine to the enjoyment of eternall life, and all the bleſſed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereto belonging) is for all men an effectual ſalvation, or ranſomed condition, although ſome men through their own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full defaults, by abuſing that freedome, are not eternally ſaved. I pray you let us conſider what extent in this point the Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth to Chriſts offices as Saviour of all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. or Ranſomer of all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>For which end, obſerve that <hi>Jude</hi> in his extraordinary diligence, clearly to diſcover the common ſalvation, expreſly called ſo by him, in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. uſed the antient types for exemplary proofes, according to the frequent example of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as appears in <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29. <hi>John</hi> 3.14. <hi>John</hi> 6.48. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22, 26.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 12. and many other places. So <hi>Jude</hi> to expreſſe his meaning concerning the common ſalvation, by him ſo called in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. brings in the Typicall antient condition of the Jewes; and to prevent all mens rejecting the effectuall benefit of the common ſalvation of all men, he ſaith, <hi>I will therefore put you in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, though you once knew this, how the Lord having ſaved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards deſtroyed them that beleeved not,</hi> ver. 5. Herein I beleeve that no man can deny, but that <hi>Jude,</hi> to open what he meant by the common ſalvation by him before ſo called, doth by comparing all the Jewes in the Type, to all men or all mankinde thereby typified, brings into our view no leſſe number than all Iſrael (none excepted) really ſaved out of their Egyptian bondage; and yet for our inſtruction in this very point, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there with, that notwithſtanding that effectual ſalvation of them all, out of that impoſſibility to ſave themſelves which they were all then in; yet after that, God deſtroyed thoſe of them that confided not in Gods power, goodneſſe, and protection only, who had himſelfe ſo mightily ſaved them.</p>
               <p>Who ſeeth not, that <hi>Jude</hi> herein apparently declareth, that all men are effectually ſaved in a common ſalvation by him mentioned, out of the impoſſibility and bondage, which by a ſpirituall Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian darkneſſe, contracted by <hi>Adams</hi> fall under the captivity of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152477:11"/>than, Typified by cruell tyrannicall <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and yet ſheweth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with that God hath done, doth, and will deſtroy all ſuch men, that though being ſo effectually inabled to beleeve and be ſaved, as is proved, that all men are, in my 6 and 7 Diſtinction, and yet will not abidingly beleeve and confide in his grace and goodneſſe only.</p>
               <p>And who ſeeth not, that by his rendring their example, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were all ſo effectually ſaved out of Egypt, yet that there was a poſſibility remaining in their owne power, that they might through their own defaults, loſe the injoyment of the fertill earthly land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that he doth thereby plainly inferre that though all men are indeed, ſo really as before ſaved in a common ſalvation, from the impoſſibility to be eternally ſaved before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>Yet as there was left in the fallen Angels, and in <hi>Adam</hi> by Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the Jewes after that their effectuall ſalvation out of Egypt, a poſſibility in their wils, whereby they might through their owne wilfull default come to deſtruction, that ſo alſo notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſaid common ſalvation of all men, men may utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive themſelves of the benefit of the ſpeciall ſalvation to be injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this need not ſeem ſtrange, for the Scripture frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth divers ſalvations to be effectuall ſalvations, although they prove not eternall; as amongſt other places, ſo where it is ſaid, <hi>That for the unthankfulneſſe and rebellion of the Jews our Types</hi> Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah 9.26. <hi>though God therefore delivered them into the hands of their enemies; yet when they cryed unto him, he gave them Saviours, who delivered them out of the hands of their enemies,</hi> ver. 27. Note here that God honoured thoſe men with the high Title of reall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours, though they procured unto thoſe ſo really ſaved people, but a poſſibility only that they might keep that their ſo reſtored free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for thoſe very ſame people though being ſo really ſaved, did after that wilfully loſe their ſo reſtored freedome againe, which is plaine that theſe people did, for the Text ſaith, <hi>but after they had reſt, they did evill againe before thee, therefore thou left'ſt them in the hands of their enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And will not even they that doe deny the common ſalvation
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152477:11"/>wrought by Chriſt, freely confeſſe that ſuch a mans life was effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaved from drowning at ſuch a time, by another mans aſſiſtance, although the ſame man ſo really ſaved, doe after that through his own default or negligence, fall into the water again, and is thereby drowned.</p>
               <p>Are we forced to confeſſe theſe ſalvations to be effectually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed inſtrumentally by Creatures, yea ſometimes by mean Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as ſalves, medicines, and potions in temporall deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? and will we not own the truth of the common ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Chriſt the Creator, to be effectuall in recovering all men from the impoſſibility to be eternally ſaved that came in by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, unleſſe he doe then eternally ſave them? doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tell us according as <hi>Jude</hi> hath done, that although all Iſrael our Types, were ſaved out of Egypt, <hi>yet with many of them God was not well pleaſed, for they were overthrown in the wilderneſſe?</hi> 1 Cor. 10.5. and that he ſtrengthneth this my Argument, ſaying, <hi>all theſe things hapned to them for examples or types,</hi> as the margent hath it, <hi>and they were written for our admonition,</hi> ver. 11. undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intimating and perſwading, that though all mankind be by Chriſt ſaved in a common ſalvation as all the Jewes were, that all men would be very carefull of abuſing their of freedome therein communicated to them, ſhewing that many of them by their ſo doing, were deſtroyed of Serpents.</p>
               <p>But now beloved be pleaſed to take notice, though ſome men, yea godly learned men have overlooked it, which is this; That abſolutely our Saviour Chriſts offices of Ranſomer or Redeemer by a price, which you know are in effect both one office, will neither of them both, nor both of them conſidered of together, admit of any larger ſalvations, redemptions nor deliverances (as to thoſe offices in any manner appertaining) but only by Ranſome or Redemption by a price, to helpe the inbondaged to their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome loſt, and ſo leaves ſuch men ſo ranſomed in a poſſibility, that afterwards thoſe ſame men may wilfully loſe that their reſtored freedome againe.</p>
               <p>For theſe ſayings, <hi>Ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.23. <hi>and redeemed with</hi> (the price of) <hi>the pretious blood of Chriſt,</hi> are ſtill but a ranſome by a price paid. Now though all men bee ranſomed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:152477:12"/>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. even for ever by that price paid, from the curſe of the Law; as is largely proved in my 4 Diſtinction, and from the firſt death, as is fully declared in my 5 Diſtinction, and are all by that ranſome or price paid, freed from the impoſſibility (that came in by <hi>Adams</hi> fall) to be eternally ſaved as is fully proved that all men are, in my 6 and 7 Dictinctions; yet there be ſome men that will count the blood of the Covenant (which is the price paid) by which they are in Chriſt ſanctified) an unholy thing, and will offer deſpite to the ſpirit of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. There be ſome that will <hi>deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> (by that ranſome or price paid) <hi>and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. So that we may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, that ſome men though they be, by that price paid, bought to Chriſt, and are, by that price paid, for ever ranſomed from the curſe of the Law, and firſt death, and the impoſſibility to be eternally ſaved, which unavoidably came over all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and alſo though they be ſanctified as before, yet that ſome men will voluntarily and wilfully deſtroy themſelves, by caſting themſelves deſperately in the eternall terrible ſecond death; and from hence appears clearly, that ſome men that are really ranſomed, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid, yet are not eternally ſaved.</p>
               <p>Yet though our Saviour Chriſts offices, of Ranſomer or Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by a price paid, doe but deliver all men from the impoſſibility to be eternally ſaved, which came over all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, yet the Scripture further affirmeth, that to thoſe men, that by and in that freedome and ability procured by that ranſome or price paid, that do turne them at his reproofe, he will (then abundantly) <hi>poure out his ſpirit unto them, and make known his words unto them, Prov.</hi> 1.23. yet thoſe and ſuch additionall high favours, are not part of the barely Ranſomed Condition, (though that made way for it) but is only Gods performing of the grace freely given by a promiſe to ſuch, by vertue of the ſecond Covenant, even to all ſuch men as doe walk before him thankfully and obediently, by the ability by grace given them in their ranſomed Condition or their Redemption (by a price paid) from the firſt Covenant or Morall Law, God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had experience of their beleeving in the freedome by the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome procured. And now beloved, becauſe this cauſe is very weighty, be pleaſed with patience to take yet further notice, how
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:152477:12"/>gratiouſly God doth diſcover to us the extent of the common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the ſtrength of ranſome and redemption by a price paid, by his coupling the offices of Chriſt as Saviour of all men, or ranſome of all, in one Text together, where it is ſaid, <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all prayers, and interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.</hi> (note this for all men) <hi>For this is good and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the ſight of God our Saviour, who will have all men to be ſaved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is but one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour between God and man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ranſome for all, to be a teſtimony</hi> (or) <hi>to be teſtified in due time,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 3, 4 5, 6. Thus you ſee that God in expreſſe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive words, will have (no fewer than) all men ſaved, he will have it ſo. But here the queſtion may be, how far will God have no fewer than all men to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>This queſtion is anſwered by God himſelfe in that very Text; firſt, that as all men are utterly diſabled by <hi>Adams</hi> fall to know the truth; ſo God abſolutely will (by Chriſt the Ranſomer) <hi>have all men ſaved and come unto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> which is to know God, for God is truth, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. And no man can be brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth, but he muſt alſo be inabled to beleeve that the truth preſented to him is the truth; Thus removing the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that came in by <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the common ſalvation of all men without accepting any one man, mentioned in 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. is ſo farre there limited in its kinde, that it ſhall be of no larger extent for the benefit of all men in generall, then Chriſts office of a Ranſomer will afford or maintaine. Thus we finde here, that all men in the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are only ſo farre really ſaved in the common ſalvation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the 4 verſe, as his office of a Ranſomer by a price paid, will extend according to verſe 6. that is, by his owne performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to recover to all men the knowledge of the truth, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by comparing verſe 4 and verſe 6 together, which ability to know God, and the truth of Gods grace and goodneſſe, all men loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, which without Chriſts aſſiſtance, would have procured the eternall deſtruction of all: Which truth ſo to all men made known, being by any man thankfully and obediently accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and faithfully and abidingly confided in, will give thoſe men
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152477:13"/>poſſeſſion of entrance into eternall life, here in this life, and in the life to come fulneſſe of injoyment thereof, with all the bleſſed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall priviledges and bleſſings thereto belonging, which were all loſt for all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
               <p>Thus by theſe Texts compated, Chriſt is declared to be for all men a ſaving Ranſomer, or a ranſoming Saviour by a price paid, to take away the impoſſibility, and to bring <hi>all men to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> which is the utmoſt which thoſe texts maintain, to belong to a Ranſomer by a price paid.</p>
               <p>But beloved, take notice that I doe not inſiſt herein upon any other redemptions which God exerciſeth by a ſtrong hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſideration given, or price paid, for ſo he brought forth or redeemed Iſrael out of Egypt with a ſtrong hand, and ſo he eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth confiding beleevers, out of the common ſalvation, wherein men may make <hi>ſhipwrack of faith and a good co ſcience,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19. into the ſpeciall ſalvation, <hi>keeping them by his power, that they ſhall never periſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. So he may be ſaid to redeem any man without any price paid, from manifold dangers: theſe redemptions or ranſomings which God doth without giving or receiving a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or price paid, are innumerable, and though the price of of the pretious blood of Chriſt, hath firſt made way for all theſe, that they may be in due ſeaſon afforded to men, yet are they not in their ſingle branches acted by God, according to mens neceſſities by a price paid; the refore I pray you to obſerve, that I herein doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt only upon the extent of deliverance of all mankind, for whom Chriſts pretious blood-ſhed, was made the conſideration laid down in full pay in hand, to take away the impoſſibility to be eternally ſaved, which unavoidably came over all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity by his fall, that ſo all men might be made capable ſubjects to receive at Gods gratious hand, all other redemptions, ranſomings, or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, without any price paid, as God in his heavenly wiſdome will communicate.</p>
               <p>Thus beloved we find, that although the common ſalvation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Chriſt alone for all men, barely conſidered in it ſelfe, doth but remove the impoſſibility which came upon all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, to be eternally ſaved, and doth but eſtate all men at one time or other in due ſeaſon, in a reall poſſibility or reſtored ability, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152477:13"/>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the inward man to obtaine eternall life, yet that it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſalvation of it ſelfe, intended on Gods part therein and thereby to inable all men ſo, as in their well uſage of that ability, they might attaine to enjoy eternall ſalvation, and all the eternall bleſſed priviledges thereto belonging; which ability conferred on all men in the common ſalvation, being by any man beleeved, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and obediently made uſe of it, it doth not only open the door into, but alſo puts ſuch beleeving men into the ſpeciall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein in due ſeaſon, in their patient and faithfull ſtriving indeavours to keep cloſe in their dependance in God alone, they come to be eſtabliſhed, rooted, and built up in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. with ſuch inlarged knowledge and experience of God and his goodneſſe, as is expreſſed in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 21. ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding beleevers, and obedient walkers in faithfull indeavours, ſhall never fall, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. See briefly what the ſpeciall ſalvation is, diſtinct from the common ſalvation, in my 19 Diſtinction, and you ſhall find that the common ſalvation by its making the way ſmooth, by diſcovering the foundation of faith and repentance, and ſo for the entrance into the ſpeciall ſalvation, is a bleſſed ſalvation, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency farre ſurmounting all temporall bleſſings in the world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of God for mens temporall bleſſings only.</p>
               <p>So that thoſe mens opinions, that do maintaine, that Chriſt doth not effectually ſave all men, except he doe eternally ſave all men, is found fallacious.</p>
               <p>As for the poſſibility, or reſtored ability conferr'd on all men in due ſeaſon <hi>to know the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. I conceive that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion (in due ſeaſon) in that text uſed, is communicated in ſuch a ſeaſonable time for every mans benefit, as God knowes to be fitteſt, God cordially intending on his part, to prevent mens fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture progreſſe in the ſinnes of unbeliefe, but however it muſt be communicated in this preſent life time and not when men are dead, for there is no hope, therefore whilſt men are yet joyned to the living, it is ſaid, <hi>a living dog is better than a dead lion, Eccl.</hi> 9.4. <hi>As the tree falleth, there ſhall it be, Eccl.</hi> 11.3.</p>

               <head>The third Distinction ſheweth, that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation firſt wrought by and in himſelfe alone, without men, laid the foundation of the common ſalvation of all men, by his deſcenſion from Heaven, and perſonall performances upon the earth.</head>
               <p>HErein we are to note, that the effects of Chriſts performances and ſufferings upon the earth, is in Scripture called <hi>a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation by his death, Rom.</hi> 5.10. and what he doth for men by his ſpirit, by his living againe reſurrection and aſcenſion into Heaven, is diſtinctly called <hi>a much more being ſaved by his life</hi> in the ſame verſe.</p>
               <p>To performe the firſt of theſe, he came downe from Heaven to the earth; to perform the ſecond, he aſcended up from the earth into heaven: The firſt he effected by the effuſion of his pretious blood upon earth for all men: The ſecond he operateth by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his ſpirit into all men; by the the firſt in the common ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he performed his fathers will, who will have (no fewer) than all men ſaved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. By the ſecond he finiſheth the common ſalvation in bringing all men to the knowledge of the truth according to Gods will alſo, as appeareth in the ſame verſe.</p>
               <p>And to the end he might be made capable to ſuffer death, <hi>or taſte death for every man,</hi> according to <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>he became fleſh, John</hi> 1 14. And although he <hi>being in the form of God, and thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equall with God, yet he made himſelfe of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Thus when the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time was come, God ſent forth his ſonne made of a woman, Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>and ſo he became the man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law</hi> (or ſame obligation which all men were under) <hi>to redeem them that were under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. Note, that it is not ſaid that he redeemed the elect or beleevers, or ſome part of men only, but to redeem them that were under the Law, in which condition by the fall, all men were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. and 5.18, 19, 20. And as without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. So by the determination of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28. and grace of God, <hi>he taſted death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>whereby his moſt pretious blood was ſhed,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Which blood of his in reſpect of his perſonall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152477:14"/>union, as compoſed of the Divine and Humane nature, is called Gods blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. the ſhedding of which is more pretious, and pacifically efficacious with God, than if all the men in the whole world had ſuffered.</p>
               <p>And therefore by this means he became the valuable propitiation for the the ſins (of no leſſe than) the whole world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. for God the Father finding him to have become voluntarily for mans ſake under the Law, and ſame obligation, into the which all men were by the fall inthralled. God the Father attached him, <hi>and laid upon him the iniquity of us all, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. and that by thoſe words (the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of us all) is meant of all mankinde; ſee my 20 diſtinction. Now the effects produced by his ſuffering upon the earth, are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally two.</p>
               <p>The firſt is his aboliſhing thereby, the eternall curſe of the Morall Law or firſt Teſtament, for every man.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, that by his death he alſo ſwalloweth up the firſt death in victory for all men: And firſt, to prove the firſt of theſe, I proceed as followeth.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="part">
               <head>The fourth Diſtinction proveth, that one means to establiſh the common ſalvation purchaſed by himſelfe, is this: This Chriſt by his death, aboliſhed the eternall condemning power of the Morall Law for all men, yet briefly ſhewing the neceſſary uſe thereof.</head>
               <p>HErein we are firſt to obſerve, that there is a Law aboliſhed by him; ſor it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>he having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, even the Law of Commandements conteined in Ordinances, Eph.</hi> 2.15. And herewith we are to know, that the ſtrength of the word aboliſhed, is a diſanulling, a deſtroying, a putting out of memory. Note alſo another full expreſſion, in this very cauſe ſpeaking of Chriſts not ſlightly croſſing that generall accuſing bill, leaving it ſtill condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably legible, but of his blotting out the hand-writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, and was contrary to us; and not only ſo neither, but for our further ſecurity he took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. Now I beſeech you conſider, what more plaine or ſtrong expreſſions, can be uſed in this cauſe; yet further to prove, that hereby is meant the aboliſhing of the Morall Law, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that as it is herein affirmed, that it is an hand-writing of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that is blotted out.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:152477:15"/>
               <p> That God never wrote any other hand-writing of Ordinances but the Morall Law only, <hi>Exod</hi> 31.18. for he added no more, <hi>Deut</hi> 5.22. Neither did <hi>Moſes</hi> write any Ordinances, but ſuch as were either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Morall Law, or mixed with Morall Law-Ordinances, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in his written books; for as God did firſt verbally declare the Morall Law at length before he wrote it, <hi>Exod</hi> 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.22. ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote not ſome of thoſe words only, but he wrote all the words of the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24.4. in one book or (hand-writing of Ordinances) untill they all were finiſhed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.24. Thus in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (all thoſe now counted five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> are accounted but one book, or hand-writing of Ordinances, and being ſo compoſed in one, <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded the Levites to put (not thoſe books in the plurall number, but) that (one) book of his hand-writing, into the ſide of the Ark of the Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.26. Therefore if the hand-writing of Ordinances, that as beforeſaid is blotted out, be referred to Gods hand-writing, then the Morall Law is aboliſhed and blotted out, for God wrote that with his owne finger, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 18. but he added no other, nor no more, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.22. And if the hand-writing of Ordinances which is blotted out, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. be referred to <hi>Moſes</hi> hand-writing, then alſo the Morall Law is blotted out; for as God ſpake all the words of the Law, ſo you ſee proved, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote all the words of the Lord, even untill all were finiſhed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.24. And he wrote no book of Ordinances, but ſuch as had and hath Morall Law-Ordinances frequently included in it, his books now counted five books, being then but one book or handwriting of Ordinances, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.26. Thus farre wee have obſerved, that the Morall Law is aboliſhed and blotted out, as it is called the Law of Commandements, or one hand-writing of Ordinances.</p>
               <p>But now I pray you let us conſider of the Morall Law, as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the firſt Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.7. or firſt Teſtament, ver. 15. which was written and engraven in ſtones, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. God having given no other Law ingraven or written in ſtones, but the Morall Law only, unto which Morall Law, the Ceremoniall Law was appointed to be pacifically ſubſervient, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1, 6. Alſo it is ſaid, that that Law alſo was but impoſed upon the Jewes, but untill the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. And as for the Morall Law it ſelfe, which was written and ingraven in ſtones, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. called there the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of death, that it was to be done away, ſee ver. 7. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152477:15"/>further in expreſſe words it is done away, ver. 11. and is aboliſhed, ver. 13. and with the downfall thereof, the very Ceremoniall Law and Prieſthood to that Law belonging, is aboliſhed utterly, and the Prieſthood it ſelfe to that Law belonging, at the comming in of the reformation, ſo limited as is ſaid in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. is fully changed from the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> for our Lord ſprang out of <hi>Judah, Heb.</hi> 7.14. and therefrom the Apoſtle affirmeth, that thereby is made upon neceſſity a change of the Law, ver. 12. Obſerve, upon neceſſity the Law muſt be changed by that change of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and for our further ſatisfaction in this point the Apoſtle ſaith, that there is verily a diſanulling of the Commandement going before, ver. 18. What can the Scripture ſay more. And beloved I thinke you will not deny but it had been very frivolous for the Apoſtle to tell the <hi>Epheſians, Eph.</hi> 2.15. that the Ceremoniall Law was aboliſhed; and to tell the <hi>Coloſſians, Col.</hi> 2.14. hat the Ceremoniall Law was blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out for them, and as much vanity it had been for him to tell the <hi>Galathians, Gal.</hi> 3.13. that Chriſt had redeemed them from the curſe of the Ceremoniall Law, for the Ceremoniall Law was never at enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with thoſe Nations, nor againſt or contrary to them; for the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Law was never in any meaſure impoſed upon any of thoſe people to obſerve (except ſome few Proſelytes.</p>
               <p>Therefore as is before proved, the Morall Law is aboliſhed and blotted out, for it was but added untill the ſeed came, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. Againe, if the Morall Law be not ſo fully aboliſhed and blotted out for all men, but that it remaines in ſuch force ſtill, that ſome men doe eternally periſh under the curſe or ſentence of that Law, and if any one man be leſt out of the protection of the ſecond Covenant, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by the firſt Death eternally for the breach of that firſt Covenant, or firſt Teſtament; then the Morall Law is not aboliſhed nor blotted out; which to affirme, is not onely a flat audacious contradiction againſt Gods manifeſt words beforeſaid, and is not only contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. where it is affirmed that Chriſts death was for the Redemption of the tranſgreſſions againſt that firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without any limitation; but conſidering that the tranſgreſſions againſt that firſt Teſtament or Morall Law, never were, are, or ever can be the unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as is by Scripture proved, in my 9, 10, and 11 Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>That affirmation to ſay that ſome men doe periſh eternally by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152477:16"/>Morall Law, proveth alſo no leſſe than a flat affronting oppoſition, againſt our Saviour Chriſts owne words, who affirmeth punctually, that <hi>all manner of ſins and blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven unto the ſonnes of men</hi> (with this one only diſtinct reſerve) that <hi>he that blaſphemeth the Holy Ghoſt, ſhall not bee forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come,</hi> as appeareth, <hi>Matthew</hi> 12.31, 32. and in <hi>Mark</hi> 3.28. And I hope you will not tax our Saviour with indiſcretion for ſo ſaying.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding, though the curſe, or eternall condemning power or ſentence of the Morall Law, is aboliſhed and blotted out, as is proved herein, and alſo in my 20 Diſtinction. Yet the holy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous requirings of Love both to God and men contained in the Law, is required by the Goſpell, <hi>for it ſaith, Love is the fulfilling of the Law, Rom.</hi> 13.10. Thus though the Goſpell deſtroyeth the eternall curſe of the Law, yet by its ſo amiably ſympathizing with the holy requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Law, by a juſticiall ſalutation of them both in Chriſt, and his propitiatory performances, <hi>MERCY and TRUTH are met together, RIGHTEOUSneſſe and PEACE have kiſſed each other, Pſal.</hi> 85.10. Thus is the righteouſneſſe of the Law (evangelically) fulfilled in them that walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. in the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, ver. 23. and will be perfectly fulfilled in them at their reſurrection and adoption, or redemption of their bodies, which beleevers wait for. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. Therefore we are not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or caſt off the holy inſtructions, which are rendered in the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, goodneſſe, and juſtneſſe of the Law, <hi>Romans</hi> 7.12. for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>he came to fulfill the Law, Matthew</hi> 5.17. And from this amiable conjunction of the Goſpell, with the holy requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the Law, the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>do we make void the Law through faith? yea we eſtabliſh the Law, Rom.</hi> 3.31. Therefore the Prophet ſpeaking of ſeeking to, and truſting in God, ſaith concerning the Law Goſpelized or teſtimony of Jeſus to the Law and to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, if they ſpeak not according to this word it is becauſe there is no light in them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Saints overcomming of Sathan, ſaith, <hi>and they overcame by the blood of the Lamb, and the words of the teſtimony, Rev.</hi> 12.11. Alſo according to the proportion of ability allotted to us here in this life, we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſee, the excellent perfect perfection, holineſſe and juſtneſſe, that is in our good God, and in that pure glaſſe, we may behold our own
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152477:16"/>pollutions and deformities; and though however ſlighted by ſome men, yet it remaines to publick view, as a famous antient pretious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument, whereby we may behold the dangerous rock, upon which without Chriſt's aſſiſtance, <hi>we all mankind had eternally ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke, Rom.</hi> 3.19. and 5.12, 19, 20. And many more excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries and righteous exhortations may be by us viewed and colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, from and in that tranſparent Chryſtall glaſſe of the equity of the Law, which for brevity ſake I do omit to rehearſe, but ſtill deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring you to take notice, that notwithſtanding the aboliſhing the eternall curſe of the Law, whereby mens accuſing firſt husband is dead.</p>
               <p>Yet in erroneous conſciences that will not know, that that their firſt husband is departed this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. <hi>and doe not by Goſpell faith, dye to the Law by the body of Chriſt, that they ſhould be married to another, even to him that is raiſed from the dead,</hi> ver. 4.</p>
               <p>In ſuch erroneous perſons by their thoughts and conſciences, excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or accuſing one another by the effects of the Law written in their hearts, they will wilfully judge themſelves according to the Law of works, and from thence are ſaid to be judged by the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11, 16. Yet it is not God that by that Law judgeth them, but it is their ſo judging themſelves erroneouſly thereby, for it being indeed their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly choſen judge, it will appeare in their conſciences, as an exact witneſſe againſt them in a Goſpell-way, reſtifying their unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full walking towards God, in his tenders of the grace of the ſecond Covenant by the Holy Ghoſt. But when God judgeth the ſecrets of mens thoughts and conſciences, then he judgeth not by the Law, but by the Goſpell, as is annexed thereto in that Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. So not thoſe words ſpoken and written by God in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> being the Law, but the words which Chriſt ſpake in the Goſpell, <hi>that ſhall judge men at the Laſt day, John</hi> 12.48. And for further proof, that the curſe of the Law is aboliſhed and blotted out for all men, peruſe my 20 Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Only to conclude, hereto note, that as <hi>Moſes</hi> was not to lead the children of Iſrael out of the wilderneſſe into the earthly Canaan no he muſt dye, and be buried in obſcurity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 34.5, 6, before that was done, and <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the type, which is by interpretation Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.8. was appointed to bring all thoſe Jewes, which had not themſelves rebelliouſly deſtroyed their intended intereſt in that earthly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:152477:17"/>Canaan: Even ſo in this very cauſe (though then but typified) <hi>Moſes</hi> Law or the firſt husband, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1, 4. muſt dye or be aboliſhed by eſtabliſhing ſuch a Goſpell-way, ſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> Law muſt not, but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell-Covenant of grace by himſelfe purchaſed with his owne pretious blood-ſhed, to bring all thoſe men into the heavenly Canaan, which have not themſelves deſtroyed their of God intended intereſt in that bleſſed inheritance in the ſpirituall Canaan, in their walking through the wilderneſſe of this terreſtrial world.</p>

               <head>The fifth Diſtinction proveth alſo, that to perfect the foundation of the common ſalvation, Chriſt by his death hath aboliſhed the firſt death for all men.</head>
               <p>IN which diſcovery we are to take notice, that there is a ſecond death mentioned in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.11. and 20.6. and 21.8. which unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably proveth, that there was a firſt death from which by Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances all men have eſcaped, not medling here with the temporall death of mens bodies, which by reaſon of the reſurrection thereof, is hardly allowed the name of death, but is frequently in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be a ſleep, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.16. as in the 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 1.21. or but a change of the body, <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52. But of the other two deaths that is the firſt death, which without Chriſts aſſiſtance, would have been by the fall eternall over all men, and the ſecond death which doth remain eternall, to all ſuch men as wilfully and perſiſting refuſe their owne mercies, tendered to them by the Holy Ghoſt by the Goſpell: Of theſe two deaths we are to note, that one of them is aboliſhed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. and that Chriſt by his death, ſwalloweth up one of theſe deaths in victory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.34. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.14.</p>
               <p>But it may be that ſome men will make a queſtion, which of theſe two deaths is by Chriſts death aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>In anſwer whereof, conſidering that <hi>Chriſt dyed for all,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>and that he taſted death for</hi> (no fewer than) <hi>all men or every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. from hence is proved, that it is that death which is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <hi>which by one mans ſinne entred into the world, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, Rom.</hi> 5.12, 17. This in Scripture is the firſt death; for all men or every man doe not periſh by the ſecond death, there be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:152477:17"/>ſome men that have part in the firſt reſurrection, over whom the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death hath no power, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.6. but this death, which is in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10 mentioned to be aboliſhed, came in over all men, in and with the firſt entrance of ſinne into the world. This ſinne in reſpect it iſſued originally by one mans offence, is called in the ſingular number the ſinne of the world, which the Lamb of God taketh away, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. And in reſpect of the overſpreading leproſie thereof, throughout mankinde in their individuals; it is in Scripture in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, called the ſins of the whole world, for all which Chriſt hath alſo made a pacificall propitiation, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. Theſe were ſins naturally againſt the Morall Law of workes, for they came in originally by <hi>Adams</hi> rebelliouſly acting againſt the Law, <hi>of do and live.</hi> Now our Saviour having by <hi>his taſting death of every man, ſatisfied juſtice for no fewer ſins, than the ſins of the whole world, in reference to the firſt Teſtament, Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. for which the firſt death came upon all men, it unavoidably followeth, that all thoſe ſins being ſo by his death deſtroied, which ſins were the ſting of (that firſt) death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. and the Morall Law or firſt Teſtament being aboliſhed and blotted out, which was the ſtrength of that ſinne, <hi>ver.</hi> 56. as is proved the Law is in my laſt Diſtinction, from hence all thoſe the worlds ſinns are not imputed to the world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. but our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. were laid upon Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. And Chriſt by his incomparable victorious conqueſt, finiſhed by his reſurrection and aſcenſion, from under the charge of thoſe the worlds ſins, and from under the power of the curſe of the Law, and power of the firſt death thereto due, he ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth up (not the ſecond death) but the firſt death in victory, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14.</p>
               <p>And hereto it is very remarkeable, there is no firſt death named in Scripture by which any one man hath done, doth or ſhall eternally pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, for that is prevented by our Saviour Chriſts performances; but when the death is named or diſtinguiſhed, by which any man doth periſh eternally, it is diſtinctly and plainely called the ſecond death, as appears plainly, in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.11, 20. and 6.14. and 21.8. for the ſecond death is the relative eternall puniſhment, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions againſt the ſecond Covenant, which is of grace, if by men greſſions againſt the ſecond Covenant, which is of grace, if by men perſiſted in, againſt the dictates of the Holy Ghoſt, which ſecond death is alſo the reſerve for puniſhment at the laſt judgement day, in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:152477:18"/>relation to mens ſoules and bodies, united by the reſurrection to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from which, Chriſts death hath no relation to diminiſh, much leſſe aboliſh as is fully proved in my 11 Diſtinction. Thus far to prove, that it is the firſt death, which together with the firſt Teſtament is aboliſhed.</p>
               <p>This recovery of all men from the eternall curſe of the law and firſt death, is a ſalvation purchaſed by Chriſt himſelfe alone without men, for all men whether any man doth beleeve that Goſpell-tidings or not, and no man enjoyeth the comfortable uſe thereof, perſonally in his conſcience but beleevers only.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="part">
               <head>The ſixth Diſtinction ſheweth, that as Chriſt hath by the ſaid ſalvation firſt wrought in himſelfe, laid the foundation of the common ſalvation of all men, by his perſonall performances upon the earth without men; ſo herein is declared how he finiſheth the ſame by his ſpirit in all men, by his reſurrection and aſcenſion into Heaven, and by his their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</head>
               <p>IN which point we are to obſerve, that our Saviour Chriſt having out of his love to mankind, by that coſtly price paying of his preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood ſhed, purchaſed and obtained of the Father, the dominion and Lordſhip over all men, both the living and the dead, for which very end, expreſly Chriſt dyed, roſe and revived, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. So to make it appear to all men (notwithſtanding the hard conceit which ſome men (againſt Scripture will harbour againſt him) that he is no hard Maſter in his dominion, nor intendeth no deſtructive ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to any one man, <hi>by reaping where he ſoweth not, and gathering where he ſtroweth not,</hi> which he rejecteth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.24. He will make it appear to publick view, that he will charitably be to all men, as the tender hearted dreſſer of the Vineyard, who would not have the barren tree cut down, although it had been a long time barren, before he have digged about it, and dunged it, and alſo waited upon it a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time to make tryall what good effects would proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from by the ſufficient means which he lovingly and diligently had therewith uſed, according to <hi>Luke</hi> 13.7, 8, 9. He will have the world ſee, that he will not put impoſſibilities upon men to be performed by them, by putting yokes upon their necks, which neither our fathers nor we were able to beare, as ſome tyrannically did upon the Diſciples,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:152477:18"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15.10. No, no, my beloved, there is no ſuch matter to be found in him, wee have experience of his faithfull and tender dealing with all men in our Types, the Jewes, for God required no oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of beaſts or other Creatures, to be by them rendred to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he firſt inabled them to perform thoſe his Commandements, by giving them thoſe Creatures ſo required by him. Alſo God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them not to go forth in warfare againſt their enemies, but as he gave them and aſſiſted them with ſufficient means, that they might thereby become victorious. God expected not that the fallen Angels ſhould keep their firſt created bleſſed eſtate, untill he had firſt inabled them to keep that their firſt habitation.</p>
               <p>But more eſpecially we are to keep in memory, Gods juſt and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious dealing with our grand parent <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the publick ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall pattern of Gods intention, in this point to all mankinde, for we ſhall aſſuredly finde, that though God did not in the counſell of his own immenſe widome, eſtabliſh him by Creation ſo as he could not fall, yet we find that God gratiouſly did not require his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to perform the keeping of thoſe firſt precepts he gave him to obſerve, untill he had firſt given him ability in himſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might have been exactly obedient thereto. Now conſidering this grace granted to and in our exemplary parent, ſhall we once perfidiouſly queſtion or ſuppoſe, that God (who commandeth (no fewer than) al men (not only in ſome particular places but) every where to repent?) <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. doth require of any one of mankind, their obedience, of faith and repentance, to be performed by them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſecond Covenant which is of grace, as to be eternally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their di obedience thereto, before he hath (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their by the fall naturall unabilities) inabled them in the inward man, minde, and will to perform the ſame.</p>
               <p>If any man be ſtill poſſeſt with ſuch falſe ſurmiſes of God, then for ſatisfaction let us read, and ſeriouſly conſider of our Saviour Chriſts Commiſſion</p>
               <p>Concerning the large extent of Gods love in Chriſt, not only to ſome men but to all mankind. Did <hi>Moſes,</hi> though but the ſervant, to whom Chriſt in conduct, and other reſpects was to be like him? <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.18. Did he in the Type by his Commiſſion conduct and inſtruct, and bring no fewer than all the Children of Iſrael out of the priſon houſe of the Egyptian bondage, from under the tyrannicall hand of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:152477:19"/>cruell <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Type of the Devill, his captiving all men at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. whilſt they doe remaine in that naturall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that came over all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall? Then obſerve what Chriſt the obedient Sonne doth by the ſtrength of his Commiſſion for all men being all by nature impriſoned Captives, ſpiritually captived under Sathans tyranny.</p>
               <p>Wherein firſt note, that as all men in their naturall eſtate, are ſo impriſoned and captivated by the Devils works originally, that <hi>for this purpoſe the Sonne of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devill,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.8. And accordingly God ſaith concerning Chriſt, <hi>I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou maieſt be my ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the ends of the earth, Iſa.</hi> 49.6. This in reference to the common ſalvation is without limitation; and that this ſalvation is for the benefit of all men, or all mankinde, obſerve what God further ſaith, <hi>my righteouſneſſe ſhall be for ever, and my ſalvation from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation, Iſa.</hi> 51.8. Thus is the promiſe performed, that was divers times promiſed to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, that in their ſeed, ſhould no fewer than all the Nations and all the Families of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> Note that theſe expreſſions of ſalvation and bleſſedneſſe are not limited either in reſpect of time, place or perſon. Again, <hi>I will give thee for a Covenant of the people</hi> (the Jewes) <hi>and for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the priſoners out of priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſſe, out of the priſon houſe, Iſa.</hi> 42.7. This is more than the opening of the priſon doors of Sathans ſpiritual inthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that all impriſoned mankind may go out; for by this his miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is to bring out the captives out of that captivity and darkneſs. This grace is unlimited, yet this doth not prove, but that ſome men may wilfully and voluntarily after their inlightenments, return to that captivity againe.</p>
               <p>And our Saviour faith, <hi>I am the light of the world, John</hi> 8.12. And leſt we ſhould miſtake what is here meant by the word (world) as many men have ignorantly done by applying the word (world) in this and divers other places, to be meant of the elect and beleevers only; therefore to prevent that abſurdity,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Baptist</hi> ſteppeth forth, and punctually affirmeth, that Chriſt is not only the <hi>light of the world, but alſo that he is the true light, that inlightneth</hi> (not ſome men only, but) <hi>every man that commeth into the world, Iohn</hi> 1.9. And to prevent that any man ſhould affirme this
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:152477:19"/>generall light, to be only a temporary light to ſome men. God no waies intending that thereby thoſe men ſhould beleeve as is required in the Goſpell;</p>
               <p>Behold that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> preſſeth ſtill more forward; and tels us thereto plainly, that that light by Chriſt communicated unto every man (not one man excepted) is of ſuch efficacy, that (no fewer than) all men through him might beleeve; compare <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7. with the 9 <hi>ver.</hi> And this he doth for all men, without price or reward by them paid, by virtue of his attonement, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.13. As in the Type no leſſe number than all the Jewes were ſet free by the atonement made in their year of Jubilee, without mony and without price, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.9. Thus according to Gods abſolute expreſſe will, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. Chriſt doth in due ſeaſon (by his inlightning every man that commeth into the world) bring all men out of their natural darkneſſe unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth.</p>
               <p>Now you know that no man can be brought to the knowledge of the truth, but firſt that mans judgement muſt upon neceſſity be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſo farre, as that he doth beleeve that the truth, ſo by Chriſt tendered, is the truth, for no man knoweth, nor can know that to be truth, which he firſt in his judgement beleeveth not to be truth; ſo that Chriſt by his bringing all men to know the truth (of God in his goodneſſe and mercy) doth thereby alſo inable all men to beleeve the truth to betruth, in which beleeving they might abide, which is full to <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7, 9. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. though ſome men will not retaine that their beleeved knowledge of God. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. and 28. and will when they are inabled to know and alſo beleeve (which cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated) that the light is light, diſtinct from darkneſſe, yet will love or chooſe darkneſſe, which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>is the condemnation. Iohn</hi> 3.19. Thus we find, that as God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance, that ſo he doth not only as in the Type lay meat before them, by preſenting Gods gratious goodneſſe to them, for them to confide in only, but he alſo taketh the ſpirituallyoke from off the jawes of all men, that they may feed on the reality of that his goodneſſe, by faith confiding in the ſame only, which ſimile is teachingly preſented to us in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4.</p>
               <p>Now herein we have a fit opportunity to take notice of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt dangerous errors, that ſome men have fallen into, by overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this impriſonment of all mens ſpirits under Sathan by the fall,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:152477:20"/>and Chriſt by his ſpirit inlighteningly preaching to all mens ſpirits ſo impriſoned in this life time upon the earth, according to <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpell to the poore, he hath ſent me to heale the broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of ſight to the blind, and to ſet at liberty them that are bruiſed.</hi> Now as all men are by nature blinde and captives; ſo this preaching of his by his ſpirit to the blind and the captives, is unlimited, for by the miſtake of ſome men, in that Chriſt by his ſpirit preacheth to all mens ſpirits ſo impriſoned in this life time upon the earth,</p>
               <p>The Papiſts to maintain their painted purgatory, have fained, that Chriſt went downe into hell in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> to preach to the ſpirits there in priſon, groſly abuſing 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19, 20. For <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſay that Chriſt by his ſpirit preached to the ſpirits that were in priſon in hell, no ſuch matter, for he ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt by his ſpirit preached to the ſpirits in priſon, which were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of God waited in the daies of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Arke was preparing</hi> (as you know upon the earth) never in the Texts mentioning the ſpirits in hell, but at that time by his ſpirit preaching then upon the earth to thoſe rebellious ſpirits that were upon the earth while the Arke was preparing. And to ſay as the truth is, ſome godly Proteſtants by their overlooking the ſaid impriſonment naturally of all mens ſpirits upon the earth, under Sathans captivity by the fall, and Chriſt by his ſpirit preaching, not only in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> as the Text ſaith he once did, but that alſo by his in ightning of every man that commeth into the world, he preacheth to all mens ſpirits, all men being by nature impriſoned in the darkneſſe of that ſpirituall priſon houſe) their judgements alſo have been dazled with this Text, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſaid of Chriſt, concerning even rebellious ſpirits (which all men are by nature) <hi>thou haſt aſcended on high, thou hoſt led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive,</hi> Sathan and all his power in captiving al mens ſpirits in darkneſſe, is by Chriſts performances and power, led into captivity under Chriſts inlightenment of every man; Thou haſt received gifts for men, or in the man, yea for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell amongſt them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.18. Obſerve the generality of this free donation; and though ſome rebellious ſpirits will not, yet all men might accept of this freedome, for Chriſt the juſt hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the unjuſt, not that he doth infallibly over-powre all men ſo,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:152477:20"/>when he hath brought them to the knowledge of the truth, which is God, for God is truth, that they never can depart from him, but Chriſt the juſt hath ſuffered for the unjuſt, not excepting any one man, all men being unjuſt, to open a paſſage with God the Father, that he might bring all men to God, which is the lively coherence of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. though ſome men will rebelliouſly depart from the living God, though ſo brought to him, <hi>and ſo draw back even to perdition, Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39.</p>
               <p>But now beloved we are ſeriouſly to obſerve, that every man muſt upon neceſſity be compelled or over-powred, to receive the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him elfe of his inlightenment and ability by grace, given unto him in the common ſalvation, for our Saviour Chriſt hath a harder taske to accompliſh the reſtoration of all men to the knowledge of the truth, then was in the Creation to make man, for <hi>Adam,</hi> who was firſt formed of the earth, made no reſiſtance to his Creation; but by reſtoration after the fall, Chriſt hath to deale with a world of men, who are all by the fall naturalized in rebellious reſiſtance againſt Chriſt his well forming hand upon his potters wheele of reſtoration; and for to effect the Creation, there needed none to ſuffer; but our Saviour Chriſt, to effect the reſtoration of all men, for the pacifying of the Fathers juſtice, was neceſſitated to ſuffer even death it ſelfe in a moſt terrible manner for rebellious mankind, who will not be ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to his gratious working and good intention towards them, as patients paſſively to ſubmit and yield themſelves unto the diſpoſe of the Phyſitian: but he hath to deale with a world of men, that as they are all by nature born ſpiritually blinde, ſo they are all very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with that their blindneſſe, all of them being by naturall deſcent from polluted <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo far inchanred by Sathan, that they doe count it injurious to be brought out of the darkneſſe of that ſpirituall impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, ſo that our Saviour Chriſt, in obedience to performe his Fathers will, who is not willing that any ſhould periſh, <hi>but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. and to help all men that they may repent, <hi>he abſolutely will have all men ſaved, and</hi> (brought or) <hi>to come unto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6. And alſo Chriſt to teſtifie his own love in performing that his Fathers will for all men, is neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, how croſſe ſoever, or how rebelliouſly ſoever all men wilfully act againſt that his gratious worke, yet to compell all men to come to the knowledge of the truth, according to his Fathers will, as is before
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:152477:21"/>he will have it ſo, there is no remedy by mens hanging backe in this cauſe, it muſt be ſo, for our good God will not, nor indeed can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo unjuſt, as to take advantage againſt any one of <hi>Adams</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, by their being unavoidably fallen into darkneſs by another mans actuall tranſgreſſion; when another hath feld the tree down, it is not ſuitable to his glorious greatneſſe and goodneſs, to hack off the boughs: Nay further, he will extend his mercy in Chriſt alſo, even to <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe alſo in his darkneſſe, who was the perſonall occaſion of the fall of all, for Chriſt inlightneth every man, all men are to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the truth, for his Father by free grate ſent him, not only to open the blind eies, and to open the ſpiritual priſon doors, but alſo to bring out the priſoners from the priſon houſe.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is not only to inlighten them that ſit in darkneſſe, but he is neceſſitated in his obedience to his Fathers will, whether men be willing or not willing to part with their naturall darkneſſe, to bring thoſe that ſit in darkneſſe, out of the darkneſſe of the priſon houſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.7. theſe being by nature all mens conditions.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee how our good and mercifull God, will not have that ſaying uſed, <hi>that the fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge, Ezek</hi> 18.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>This ſpirituall preaching of the Goſpell by Chriſts word, or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſervants or creatures, to all men, is called <hi>the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which is within you, Luke</hi> 17.21. which appeareth by comparing <hi>mat.</hi> 3.2. with <hi>Mark</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>And from ſuch expreſſions, by likening divers things to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven, our Saviour uttered many parables, as is inſtanced by the parable of the ſower and his ſeed, and of the drag-net, and of the leaven, and of the Feaſt.</p>
               <p>Wherein note, that to declare the compulſion of all men, internal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receive the infranchiſement aforeſaid in the common ſalvation, Chriſt ſets forth the ſame ſeeds-man ſowing of the ſame ſeed, even the word of the Kingdome upon foure ſorts of ground, repreſenting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the ſorts of ground, or of men, which were compelled all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to receive the ſowing or falling of the ſeed upon them; for the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile holds not, nor maintains not, that any of thoſe ſorts of ground, no not the beſt ſort of ground, uſed any means, or deſired that the ſeed ſhould be caſt upon them, yet it is ſaid (in effect) that all thoſe grounds were (by the act of ſowing the ſeed upon them) made to hear
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:152477:21"/>the word, and alſo ſome of the bad grounds did receive it with joy, <hi>Mat</hi> 13.19, 23. and alſo ſome of the bad grounds ſprang up, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.6. which ſhewes that there is an ability given by the ſeed ſowing even on the bad grounds, for they had no ſuch ability of their own, but they by one means or other in that ability ſuffered one interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or other to faſten upon them, ſo that only that ground called the good ground, did bring forth good fruit thereby.</p>
               <p>But ſtill note here with, that the goodneſſe thereof is not attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a ſurmounting Almighty power of God, extended to that ground over and above, or more than the other grounds, but it is attributed, as in the ſimile, in effect to the due obedience of the ground, or of men being found well acting in the ability by grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to all men, by Chriſt the ſeeds-man, by ſowing the ſame ſeed upon it, which ſeed he alſo ſoweth on all perſiſting diſobedient men; for if the goodneſſe thereof were not attributed to its own wel acting in ability of will by grace ſo reſtored, but to a ſurmounting Almighty power of God, unreſiſtibly overpowring it, more then was granted to the other grounds, then it were groſſe abſurdity with men, much more for us to conceive of our impartiall good God, who is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.11. That he ſhould eſteem of that ground, and that he ſhould ſo partially and highly prefer that ground as being good, rather than the other grounds, conſidering, that if thoſe bad grounds had been ſo over-powred, they could not have avoided it, but they muſt perforce have brought forth as good fruit, as that ground accounted good ground did. But</p>
               <p>Theſe grounds to ſay, as the truth is, do repreſent the rationall man, conſiſting of body and ſoule in all men, which rationall man is ſet forth diſtinct from the Old and New man in the latter part of my 1 Diſtinction, the rationall man being in all men, inthralled in an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unability (in reſpect of Saving Acts) by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, yet are all in due ſeaſon. Thus by this generall ſeeds-man (that as you ſee pro ed ſowes his ſeed, or the word of the Kingdome on all grounds, or all men, ſo that) ſo that all were infranchiſed in their naturall deaſe condition, ſo as to heare the word (with the ears of internall minds as <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19, 23. plainly declareth, that all the ſorts of ground did. And herein is repreſented ſome rationall men ſo inlightned by the title of the good ground, as found well acting or fruitfully by faithfull indeavours acting in the uſe of that their infranchiſment when the other grounds
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:152477:22"/>alſo ſo inabled by the ſame ſeeds-man and ſeed, yet are found rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly acting, and for ſecondary carnall ends, caſting oft the benefits by that grace given unto them, and therefore are called bad grounds.</p>
               <p>And yet obſerve, that though one ground is imputatively by grace commended to be good ground, yet know, that no man though being found well acting by faith and obedience in his infran hiſement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by the ſeed ſowne on all, when as ſome other men being ſo inabled alſo, are found rejecting thoſe works of grace, or ſeed ſown on them alſo; yet as the Angels that never fell, nor <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had remained in his created innocency, could not have merited reward as due debt from the Creators hand, otherwiſe than he is pleaſed to maintain his ſecond Covenant by his free grace given; ſo much leſſe doth this ground, or thoſe men here called or accounted, or imputed good, merit any reward at Gods hand, but as God is pleaſed by grace according to his ſecond Covenant, to account and to impute them to be good that beleeve in him that juſtifyeth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Kingdome of Heaven is compared to a net caſt into the ſea, which gathereth together every kind, <hi>which when it was full, they drew to ſhore, and ſate down and gather d the good into veſſels, and coſt the bad away, Mat.</hi> 13.47, 48. Note herein, that all men (repreſented by the fiſhes) good and bad, are inforced to receive the word of the Kingdome in this ſence, here by the ſimile of the drag-net called the Kingdome of Heaven, for all both good and bad, will they, nill they, were compelled to partake of the ſame condition in the net; though ſome was found in that drag-net compared to the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that in their continued badneſſe were caſt away. Note that no man is or was created bad, but as he makes himſelfe bad, as is often proved in this tract.</p>
               <p>And now conſider how lively both theſe parables repreſent the common ſalvation, where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>and I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me, John</hi> 12.32. He will not only by his ſpirit invite all men to come unto him, but he will draw as in the drag-net, not only ſome men, but all men unto him not in the leaſt meaſure on his part for deſtructive ends to any one of all men ſo drawn to him, but for ſaving ends on his part for every man, <hi>for his Father ſent not his Sonne into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved, John</hi> 3.17. Which yet appears more clearely
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:152477:22"/>where it is ſaid, that God doth reconciledly gather together in one to himſelfe, not only all men, but all things by the blood of his Croſſe, in him, even in him, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. being compared together, doe plainly render. Thus this reconciled gathering or drawing together of all men in Chri8ſt, even in him, includeth all men good and bad, reconciledly gathered to God in him, though ſome men being ſo gratiouſly gathered together in him in the common ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, will notwithſtanding by their wilfull perſiſting in the abuſe of the benefit thereof, be caſt out or caſt a way. But how comes it to paſſe, that no fewer than all men good and bad, are in that ſence drawn to, or are made partakers of the word of the Kingdome, or Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>or the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. In anſwer to this, the means how, is ſhewed by our Saviours compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the large and ſecret working of the ſpirit to Leaven, our Saviour ſaying, <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven is like leaven, which a woman tooke and hid in three meaſures of meale, untill</hi> (no leſſe than) <hi>all was leavened.</hi> Note that untill no leſſe than all was leavened.</p>
               <p>Herein is the Kingdome of Heaven, or the word of the Kingdome, as it is called in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. comparatively ſet forth to be as Leaven, infuſing it ſelfe effectually, not only into ſome part, but into all parts of the meale, ſimilizing thereby, that light, and therewith ability to know the truth and chooſe it, is effectually by a ſecret, yet powerfull operation of the ſpirit infuſed into all men, as in <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 9. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. is proved.</p>
               <p>Againe, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven is like unto a certaine King which made a marriage for his ſonne, Mat.</hi> 22.2. Unto which Feaſt, the firſt that were compelled, or made to know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by invitation, having refuſed, he commanded to gather together bad and good, and the wedding was (thereby) furniſhed with gueſts, ver. 10. Note that this gathering together of all by command, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be no leſſe than a compelling of them all, good and bad, to come into (in the aforeſaid ſence) into a terreſtriall Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or thereto likened, compell them to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. or gather together good and bad and bring them in; no man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that all good and bad were to be brought together into one locall place, or into Gods celeſtiall Kingdome, but into one condition of ability, to ſee and to know of the truth and reality of Gods goodneſſe and mercy extended by the ſlaying of Chriſt the unſpotted Lamb that by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152477:23"/>faith they might feed thereon, for none of them were further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to feed thereon, as by the words of the Text is cleared, and the firſt refuſers were ſo farre compelled by invitation. But beloved, this compelling or bringing in of all men, good and bad, to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the terreſtriall Kingdome of Heaven (ſo called or likened to, in this Scripture ſence) or to receive the word of the Kingdome, ſo called, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.19. doth no way countenance that opinion which ſome men have vainely hatched from thoſe words, affirming that there is no man ſaved eternally, but only ſuch men as are compelled by an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of God, more than ſome other men are; not only to know the truth, as is proved that all men are, according to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. But alſo that thoſe men are compelled to abide in the truth by beleeving, ſo that infallibly whether they will or no, they ſhall not faile, nor be able to reſiſt againſt their eternall ſalvation in Gods Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall Kingdome, whereas in truth, there is no ſuch matter main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, for herein by comparing Scripture with Scripture, we find the clean contrary, that is; that in a common ſalvation, all men good and bad, are compelled in, and gathered in to receive the word of the Kingdome, or the knowledge of the Feaſt of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (not only intended, but alſo prepared for them) by the ſelf ſame mens, as the forcibly incloſing and drawing of all, good and bad, in the parable of the drag-net doth diſcover. And thereby ſome gathered together, and by command, compelled in, were found there, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on a wedding garment, therefore caſt out, as thoſe that followed Chriſt for the loaves ſake, <hi>John</hi> 6.2. whereas no bad or unclean perſon, no tpurifyed by faith, can be compelled in neither can poſſibly enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods celeſtiall eternall bleſſed habitation repreſented, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8, 27. nor any being once there, can be caſt out; and though ſome men for an evading ſhift, have reply thereto, ſaying that it was but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that was found there compelled in, who had not on a wedding garment, and therefore little notice can be taken of that man, being but one, I anſwer thereto; that that one being there ſo found com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled in, is ſufficient to confute that their fancyed imagination. But behold, that our Saviour maketh a farre larger application thereof; for as there was ſome bad found, compelled in to this condition, called or counted like the Kingdome of Heaven, whereas no bad perſon can be compelled in, nor enter into Gods heavenly habitation. And our Saviour affirmeth upon that very example of the caſting out of that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:152477:23"/>one man, though there be but one mentioned, that as he had ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that all were gathered or compelled together, both good and bad, ſo accordingly even from that one his being caſt out, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that though many are called (yet) but few are choſen, in the very next ver. 14. Now taking but a few out of the many called, this ſets forth a greater number of men, who though called in to receive the word of the Kingdome, and know the truth and reality of Gods goodneſſe prepared for them by the Feaſt, yet by their wanting their wedding garments there, of thankfull, loving, obedient acceptance, and faithfull indeavours to walk humbly therein, they are all of them caſt out, and few are choſen.</p>
               <p>Hereto if you will be pleaſed to owne it, that no fewer than all, is very often in the Scripture, comprehended in the word (many) as is fully proved in my 8 Diſtinction; and that all men are called by Chriſts inlightning (no fewer) than every man that commeth into the world; ſo that (no fewer than) <hi>all men through him might beleeve,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 9. and that by him all are ſo farre called, that they are all in due ſeaſon, made to come <hi>unto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> according to the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. by Gods owne ſhewing it even to the Heathens alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. and 2.14, 15. From hence, and many ſuch like Texts, we may warrantably conclude, that all men are by the ſpirit invited or called, and inabled, though none be choſen, but ſuch men only, as do make good uſe of their infranchiſement and inlightenment, and by their ability received in the call, do themſelves abide in beleeving, and ſo are not only called or compelled in, as all men are, but are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be faithfull, and are choſen, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.14.</p>
               <p>And the ſence of the Greek word, <hi>Biazetai,</hi> uſed <hi>Luke</hi> 16.16. as the Learned ſay, is to be read; the Kingdome of God is preached, and every man is preſſed into it, which can bee but by infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement to receive the word of the Kingdome, for no man is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo compelled, than as <hi>Adam</hi> was to be inabled by grace in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to obtaine eternall life, though ſome men ſo inabled by their perſiſting in, and abiding in obedient beleeving, after ſome tryall of their faith, are by Grace eſtabliſhed in the priviledges of the ſpeciall ſalvation, as is elſewhere ſaid, and is proved in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12, 13. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that all men are utterly diſabled by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and ſo by nature cannot be obedient to the faith; then if all men be not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152477:24"/>inabled by Chriſts ſpirit, to become obedient to the faith, and abide therein, but as they are compelled by a ſurther Almighty power of God, then that tenent being maintained, doth caſt a groſſe ſoile in the face of our juſt dealing impartiall faithfull Creator, and all his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exhortations, dehortations, reproofes, promiſes, threatnings, rewards and puniſhments, which is recorded in the holy Scripture to be proceeded in, for or againſt men, according to all mens own actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and perſonall obedience, or diſobedience to the faith; for by that tenent, obedience is required of ſome men, and promiſes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are declared to be diſpenſed to them, according to their perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obedience, or diſobedience, whereas they are utterly diſabled by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and by Gods withholding means of inabling them, from them, it proves totally impoſſible for them to perform the leaſt part of the obedience required, and if that tenent were true, then alſo obedience to the faith is required of ſome men, and promiſes and threatnings declared to them, alſo to be diſpenſed according as they perſonally do prove obedient or diſobedient to the faith; whereas thoſe men by a ſurmounting power of God, granted more to them, than to the other men ſhall not, nor cannot poſſibly be able to doe or act otherwiſe, than to be ſavingly obedient to the faith, neither can they be able to reſiſt againſt their eternall ſalvation. But to rip o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the bowels of this fallacy, we ſee it is here proved by Scripture, that all men are in due ſeaſon ſo inabled by Chriſt by a common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſavingly to beleeve and repent, and thereby thoſe ſtrained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams are vaniſhed, and that thereby the perfect holineſſe of all the attributes of God, is unitedly cleared, whereby alſo no leſſe than all occaſion, for any one mere man to boaſt before God, is totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and that no man is in the leaſt meaſure wrorged, although God doth not only require but alſo command no fewer than all men in all places to repent, as he doth in <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. and to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. <hi>and to give an account of himſelfe to God, Rom.</hi> 14.12. <hi>and to be obedient to his reproofe, Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>and to humble themſelves, Mat.</hi> 23.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>purge themſelves,</hi> as in 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21. <hi>and to turne themſelves, Nehe.</hi> 19. and that hereby it doth plainly appeare (that conſidering all mens inablement by Chriſt) not any one man is in the leaſt meaſure injured, although God doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally proceed in judgement with every particular man according to that which he himſelf hath actually and perſonally done in his body, whether
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:152477:24"/>it be good or bad, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. for God doth not judge every man, nor any man, according to works inforced to be done in his body, by the corruption that unavoidably came over him by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to unbeleeving works, which any man is neceſſitated to doe by a decreed reprobation or preterition of God, by his withholding means of inabling from them, as ſome men groſly imagine, neither doth he judge any man, according as he is inforced to act beleeving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether he will or not, by an over-ruling Almighty power of God, by God wrought in his body, but being inabled of God by Chriſt, <hi>he judgeth every man, according to the things he</hi> (himſelfe) <hi>hath done in his body, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. as hath been touched, or according to works (not inforced by God or <hi>Adams</hi> fall) <hi>but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works, Rev.</hi> 20.13. being as is ſaid, firſt inabled by God to be obedient, then God proceedeth ſtrictly without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>or any reſpect of perſons,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. all which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars are proved, and is one maine drift of this whole tract.</p>
               <p>And further, to prove that God doth not by a ſurmounting Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, compell any man after that he is inabled to beleeve; ſo that then unalterably he ſhall abide in beleeving, except it be in the caſe of his eſtabliſhing of perſiſtingly abiding humbled beleevers, after ſome tryall of their faith into the priviledges of the ſpeciall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which eſpeciall ſalvation, is ſet forth in my nineteenth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.</p>
               <p>For we have many examples therein, that God doth not ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power inabled ones, before he hath had ſome tryall of their faithfull conſtancy to keep the faith, which they are by grace inabled to doe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12, 13. for obſerve, though it may be ſaid that he compelled the refuſing gueſts, to know of the reality of the Feaſt, and his good will therein intended to them by his inviting of them, which reality they queſtioned, not much leſſe denyed for they in effect confeſt that, by their deſiring to be excuſed for their not comming to it; yet you ſee that God did not by an almighty power, further compell thoſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though refuſing gueſts to come to the feaſt, much leſſe to ſeed thereon; reither did he compell that party, not having a wedding garment, to abide at the Feaſt, although he had by command, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him to come into it.</p>
               <p>Neither do we read that he compelled any other of the gueſts to feed on the Feaſt, though he had compelledly brought them in to it, and inabled them to feed thereon.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:152477:25"/>
               <p> Neither in our Types the Jewes, after he had given beaſts and other creatures to offer, whereby they were by him made able to offer up to him in Sacrifices, ſuch of them, as he to that end required of them, yet did he not then compell them by an Almighty power, to offer up thoſe beaſts to him, whether they would or not.</p>
               <p>Neither, though God had uſed ſuch compulſion by the fire, as rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſcum in the ſeething pot, ſo as men might themſelves have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it off, which repreſents his dealing with all men, yet you ſee he did not uſe a further Almighty power to take it off himſelfe, nor to inforce them ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>Neither when he had given the children of Iſrael weapons, and ability to enter into the terreſtriall land of Canaan, then compell them by an almighty power, to beat out their enemies in <hi>Moſes</hi> time.</p>
               <p>Neither though God made the fallen Angels to receive the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their bleſſed firſt eſtate, and made them to receive ability in themſelves, to keep that their firſt habitation, yet you ſee God did not further than compell thoſe Angels to keep that their eſtate or firſt habitation.</p>
               <p>And although it may be in ſome ſort ſaid, that he compelled <hi>Adam;</hi> Firſt, to enjoy a living being; Secondly, to receive the actuall poſſeſſion of his bleſſed eſtate, prepared for him by the grace of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And Thirdly, made him to receive an ability in himſelfe, to have kept that his bleſſed glorious eſtate, yet you ſee God did not by a further Almighty power, compel him whether he would then or not, to keep and continue in in obedience, and to keep that his bleſſed eſtate, although herein in this point he was the great and leading patterne of Gods intention concerning all mankind to the whole ſucceeding world, and al we his poſterity by his example are not to expect at gods hands (though he doth by Chriſt inable all men evangelically to keep the ſecond Covenant, which is of grace, as he did inable <hi>Adam,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to keep the firſt Covenant of works by doing) that he will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh his poſterity with a more eſtabliſhed condition, than he did him, our grand parent, and exemplary patterne.</p>
               <p>And ſo farre he doth inable all men, that they all may or might be obedient; for as hath been ſaid, and indeed cannot too often be ſaid, that our bleſſed Saviour Chriſt, by a ſalvation firſt purchaſed at a dear rate by himſelfe alone, by his ſufferings and performances upon the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:152477:25"/>earth for al men, with out men; and then by his reſurrection and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into Heaven, or by his being in Heaven, from thence by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit operating in all men, and thereby inabling all men in the inward man in due ſeaſon, ſo effectually, as that thereby, they all by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving might obtaine eternall life; yet as hath been ſaid and proved, no man is compelled by a further Almighty power, to abide inbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or obedience to the faith, whether they then, when being ſo inabled, will or not, neither ſo over-powered, that they ſhall not be able to cloſe their internall eyes againe, leſt ſo remaining ſeeing, they ſhould be healed, as we ſee thoſe did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15.</p>
               <p>Yet God never faileth in due ſeaſon, when he ſeeth fit, to eſtabliſh perſiſting, abiding, humbled beleevers (who are found to have ſome good progreſſe in the faith, by their well uſing that ability by grace given them) theſe he eſtabliſheth in the priviledges of the ſpeciall ſalvation, wherein he ſealeth them after they beleeved, with the holy ſpirit of promiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. and therein affordeth them many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſpirituall viſits, <hi>as to eate of the hidden Manna, and alſo giveth them a white ſtone with a new name written in it, which no man knows but he that receives it, Rev.</hi> 2.17. And obſerve that by this reall abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aforeſaid, by Chriſt communicated unto all men, from thence he ſaith, <hi>without me you can do nothing, John</hi> 15.5. therewith alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting men to abide in that ability by beleeving, <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 6. and there alſo ſheweth the danger of thoſe men that will not abide; alſo from that ability received, beleeving people doe triumphantly ſay, <hi>Not of our ſelves, but by thee only will we make mention of thy name, Iſa.</hi> 26.13. and in conſideration that ſome people do willingly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully act in that by grace reſtored ability, given to all men to know the truth, which God foreknowing, they by him are called Gods people or elect, according to his foreknowledge, agreeable to the proofes cite in my 17 Diſtinction; and from hence it is ſaid, <hi>thy people ſhall come willingly in the day of thy power, Pſal.</hi> 110.3.</p>
               <p>Thus herewith keeping in our memories, though God in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſaith, <hi>what could I have done more to my vineyard, that I have not done? Iſa.</hi> 5.4. Which vineyard as in the Type, repreſenteth all the men of the world, as appeareth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. yet you ſee he did not by an almighty power force them to bring forth good fruit, but he proceeded only by taking away the obſtructions that hindered them ſo to doe, that they might by the benefit of that good means uſed with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:152477:26"/>them, bring forth good fruit, and then expected good fruit from them or their owne performances, in their good uſe of that means he had gratiouſly uſed with them, as fully appears in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. And whereas God ſaid, <hi>what could I have done more for my vineyard,</hi> you know that God could if he had ſo pleaſed, by his Almighty power, have ſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed them, as that they no waies could have brought forth bad fruit; but he having in his tranſcendent wiſdome, after the counſell of his owne will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. determined not to inveſt mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, in any further ability in themſelves, but only by taking away the obſtructions that came in by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and therewith to inable all men ſo in the inward man, as that thereby they all might in their uſage of that ability, prove obedient to the faith, as appears in our grand paterne <hi>Adam,</hi> that God did but inable him to be obedient, from this determinate councell of his owne will, and glorious wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he in that text ſaith, <hi>what could I have done more,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But for the further clearing of what hath been ſaid, let us obſerve that never ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, God hath not, nor doth not intruſt any one meer man with an ability in himſelfe, thereby to be transferred to any other perſon, as it might have been transferred from <hi>Adam</hi> by generation to his poſterity if he had ſtood. No beloved, God never ſince the fall, doth truſt any man with any ſuch ability in himſelfe, but our Saviour Chriſt only, who as the publick man or ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> is intruſted with all the power and ability which is to be be transferred to any man, that power is inveſted in him only, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by becauſe no one man ſhould ſuffer loſſe in that point, by the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> fall, he gratiouſly communicates by his ſpirit to every man, and doth intruſt every man with an ability, whereby he in the good uſe thereof, might be eternally ſaved, ſo farre as concernes his owne perſonall injoiment for himſelf alone, excepting only what good ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man may receive from him by his good example and inſtructions and prayers. But perhaps ſome man will ſay, in reſpect of what hath been by me formerly declared, how can it appeare that our Saviour Chriſt hath redeemed all men from the curſe of the Law and firſt death, according to your 4 and 5 Diſtinctions, when as it is evident, that ſome remaining effects of the curſe of the Law, and alſo of the firſt death, are as yet unremoved from off the earth, and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that the generall curſe mentioned in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:152477:26"/>
                  <hi>Curſed is the ground for thy ſake,</hi> conſidering that that is but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall curſe and affliction; this curſe is not of the nature of that which the curſe of the Law would have effected, for without the Covenant of grace applied, as it is promiſed to the woman, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. (in the ſame Chapter) the curſe of the Law would have been eternall.</p>
               <p>So that this aforeſaid curſe of the ground, which doth remaine but temporally, cannot be ſaid to be the curſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>But God having had experience of <hi>Adams</hi> wilfull rebellion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience againſt him, by his being ſo diabolically puffed up in pride, with his excellent eſtate of Creation, and his glorious enjoyment of the perfection of the Creatures, as created for him, God not for deſtructive, but gratious ends for all men, only blaſts the gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Creatures, as Created, ſaying, <hi>curſed is the ground for thy ſake,</hi> as if ſaid, becauſe thou haſt (though inabled by me to doe the contrary) ſo wilfully and rebelliouſly betraid the truſt which I repoſed in thee, for thy ſelfe and thy poſterity, by thy being intruſted with ſo bleſſed and glorious eſtate (for thy ſake) I will never againe truſt thee nor thy ſtained poſterity, with the uſe of the glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in that beauty and excellency, in which they were created by me, but having had experience of thy unfaithfulneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the uſe of them (for thy ſake) I will never againe hazard the eternall favour I intend for thee and thine, in ſuch an alluring eſtate, whereby the hearts and affections of thee and thine, may probably hereafter come to be alienated againe from me and my grace, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and goodneſſe; but I will in my tender mercy by grace exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Goſpell or ſecond Covenant, by a curſe out of my mercy, temporally blaſt thoſe rare created beauties and excellencies of the Creatures, provided for thee and thine; and this on Gods part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hide pride from mankind in generall, as we frequently finde that he doth, not by deſtructive, but gratious intentions, afflict par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men in divers manners, to hide pride from particular perſons, as appeareth in <hi>Job</hi> 23.17, 19. and very many other places, which ſheweth, that as God to that gratious end, afflicteth the whole world of mankind in generall, by the effects of that mercifull curſe, by him ſetled, concerning the ground or whole earth; ſo God affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth particular men out of his mercy, to the end, intended on his part, that men ſhould turne in to him, his grace and protection only, for in thoſe afflictions, though they ſeem burthenſome to fleſh and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:152477:27"/>blood, yet therein and thereby he waiteth to be, or that he may be gratious, as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18.</p>
               <p>And how can we harbour in our breaſts, ſuch hard conceits of our faithfull Creator, and good and impartiall God, as to account thoſe his mercifull curſes or afflictions, to be of the nature, which was in the eternall curſe of the Law, which without Chriſts aſſiſtance, would have been everlaſting upon all men, eſpecially conſidering that our gratious God hath declared to us, which he expecteth we ſhould take thankfull notice of, which is, that on his part, all his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are (not only good, but) good to all (and that not only his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but alſo) his tender mercies are over (not only ſome, but over) all his works? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9.</p>
               <p>So that that curſe, affliction or afflictions, proceeds from the grace of the ſecond Covenant, intended on Gods part, for mercifull ends to all men, though ſome men, after their infranchiſement and inlightenment, doe wilfully perſiſt in abuſing that grace, and ſo as perverſely by their owne voluntary choiſe, doe loſe the eternall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, intended on Gods part for them thereby.</p>
               <p>And as for the ſmall or weake remaining power of the firſt death, which the aforeſaid query ſo much ſcruples at, conſidering that by Chriſts death, that death hath no more power left it, but temporally to bring all mens bodies to the grave or earth, from which it was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and to hold them there, untill the generall reſurrection menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12, 15. Wee may not be much troubled to find out that that is an exceeding bleſſing alſo, as it is intended of God on his part for all men, being folded up in a mercifull, gentle curſe, by that death or ſleep, to make way, or open the paſſage for the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of all mens bodies to be brought in by Chriſts performances.</p>
               <p>For by thoſe words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat bread, till thou returne unto the ground, for out of it waſt thou taken, for duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou returne.</hi> This ſaying, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it appears to humane wiſedome, yet it doth but teſtify Gods love to all men, in that by his grace in Chriſt, he hath provided a way, that whereas death, even the eternall firſt death, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibly have ſeized on all men, to procure their everlaſting ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God and his bleſſed preſence; yet that now, even from the acceptation of Chriſts blood, as if it had been actually ſhed at <hi>Adams</hi> fall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. No man ſhall be, nor can be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:152477:27"/>but temporally mortall, and that alſo concerning their bodies only; for as Chriſt by his death hath brought in life from that firſt death, <hi>which came over all men by ſins entrance, Rom.</hi> 5. and alſo therewith, <hi>immortality of the Goſpell,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. Even ſo by Gods gratious Ordinance, <hi>It is appointed for (all) men once to dye, Heb.</hi> 9.27. that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary death of the body, and God by that death or ſleep, or change of the body, doth gratiouſly ſtrip all mankinde of that curſed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, into which all men fell by ſins entring into the world, ſo that although all mens bodies from that ground, are ſowne mortall bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53. Gods intention being to make that kind of death, or rather ſleep, a means by Chriſt, that all men might be raſed up at the generall reſurrection, not only immortall, but alſo in his prime inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his part, that they ſhould all of them be eternally bleſſed, in that their immortality, which the mortall death of the bodies of all men by Gods wiſedome and mercy made way for; ſo that the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death of the body, whereby by grace they are ſtripped of mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it being the dore of entrance into immortality, is an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mercy, intended of God for all, and proves effectually ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers: and though ſome men after their inlightenment, doe perſiſt in perverſe wilfull unbeleefe, yet even they alſo ſhall for ever remaine immortall at the reſurrection of the body, though by their own choiſe, they for ever loſe the bleſſedneſs that of God was intended they ſhould have enjoyed for ever, in that their immortality, they themſelves tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the bleſſedneſſe thereof, into an immortall curſed living being, yet is the temporall death as God intended by grace in Chriſt, to make uſe of it for all men, ſo farr from a curſe in its own Nature, that it is an exceeding great bleſſing alſo.</p>
               <p>And now craving your patience a little further, concerning the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and inlightning of all men, we may note, that in the caſe of little children, whileſt they remaine in their weakneſſe and imbecillity of their underſtanding, and alſo all Ideots and Fooles that were ſo born, and doe ſo continue, as they never had ability afforded them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Doctrine of the Goſpell, nor actually and perſonally to reſiſt the ſpirits teaching, nor doe wittingly forſake God, who infallibly doth never forſake any one perſon, untill that man or perſon, forſaketh him firſt, as is fully proved in my 16 and 17 Diſtinctions; and as little children, and alſo ſuch Ideots and Fools are not capable of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be againſt Chriſt and the Goſpell, of ſuch our Saviour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:152477:28"/>that he that is not againſt us, is on our part, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.40. And as they are not capable to refuſe light, and chooſe darkneſſe, <hi>which is the condemnation, John</hi> 3.19. So there is no condemnation to them by the Goſpell, and as for the Law, they are alſo free from that charge of ſinne; for Chriſt hath redeemed, not only them, but alſo all men from the curſe of the Law and firſt death, as is largely proved in my 4 and 5 Diſtinctions. And our Saviour alſo affirmeth of little children, <hi>that of ſuch is the Kingdome of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.14. and ſaith, <hi>that they beleeve in him, Marke</hi> 9.43. And our Saviour affirmeth, not only of little children, but of men alſo, ſaying, <hi>except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Mark</hi> 10.15. and <hi>Luke</hi> 18.17. And of thoſe men that humble themſelves as a little child, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>the ſame is the greateſt in the Kingdome of Heaven, Mat.</hi> 18.4.</p>
               <p>And beloved, God hath not left us without examples of this truth; for notwithſtanding that it is ſaid, that all the <hi>Congregation of the Jews, bed ſtone</hi> Joſhua <hi>and</hi> Caleb (the faithfull ſpies) <hi>with ſtones, Num.</hi> 14.10. In which act, no doubt can be made, but that all thoſe of 17, 18, 19, 20 years of age, had a hand, yet Gods mercy is held forth to them, and he chargeth none of them with that rebellious ſinne of unbeleefe, that were under the age of 21 yeares, for all of them that were under that age, he accounted them their little ones, <hi>Num.</hi> 14.31. their children, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. and doth paſſe by all their offences, being under that age of 21 yeares, as not knowing betwixt good and evill, as clearly appeareth by comparing <hi>Num.</hi> 4.29. with <hi>Deur.</hi> 1.39. Now conſidering, that all ſuch dealings of our gratious God with them, were written for our admonition and example, as appeareth they were, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. though I know not whether we may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by conclude, that God alwaies granteth an uncapability to be in man, and that God doth not take notice of any mans unbeleefe, and unthankfulneſſe, as to be eternally puniſhable, untill he be above 20 years of age, yet we may conclude, that he doth not exclude or ſhut out any man from his grace of the ſecond Covenant, be he young or old, that as yet are not by him made capable to accept of grace, nor ſhuts out any ſuch perſons, as neither doe, nor can wittingly reſiſt the tenders thereof.</p>

               <head>The ſeventh Distinction ſetteth forth, that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the common ſalvation even to all the Heathens alſo, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther written Law nor Goſpell is vouchſafed unto them, otherwiſe then the effects thereof are written in their hearts.</head>
               <p>TO ſet forth which, obſerve, that although it be ſaid, <hi>that there is no other name given under heaven, wherby men muſt be ſaved</hi> according to <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. yet that doth not prove, that the want of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that very name to any people, doth put them into a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternall condemnation; but on the contrary doth implicitely confirme, <hi>that as Chriſt is the Saviour of no fewer than all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. ſo God doth by him communicate an inabling common ſalvation to all men, as in my laſt Diſtinction, and alſo an eternall ſalvation to all beleevers or confiders in his goodneſs, only by a virtue derived from that name only, and his performances for all men, even for ſuch men as was never made acquainted with Chriſts very name, nor the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of his performances. Herein we are to take notice, that there is a conſiding and beleeving in him, or in God that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, that is imputed for righteouſneſſe, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſaith was imputed unto him for righteouſneſſe, by beleeving that God notwithſtanding the deadneſſe of his body, and of <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe, by ſo quickning the dead, would multiply his ſeed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17, 18, 19. And the Apoſtle ſaith, that this imputation of Righteouſneſſe unto him, was not written for his ſake alone, that it was imputed unto him, but for us alſo to whom it ſhall be impured, if we <hi>beleeve on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, Rom.</hi> 4.24. Thus the very Heathens that have not the written Law or Goſpell, otherwiſe than the effects thereof are written in their hearts, even they by their belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and confiding in the goodneſſe of him only, or of God only, that railed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, is warrantably, according to the ſcope of that Text, accounted to them for righteouſneſſe, which they may doe by their ability received in themſelves by Chriſt in the common ſalvation, by their being all of them brought to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth of Gods grace and goodneſſe, as is proved in my laſt Diſtinction, although the very name of Jeſus, and particulars of his performances, which procureth that goodneſſe for them, be not diſcovered unto them; and this is made apparant for the unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:152477:29"/>of the very Heathens, as is proved, where it is ſaid, <hi>deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe, and forbearance, and long ſuffering, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (or remembring, as in ſome tranſlations) <hi>that the goodneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance, Rom.</hi> 2.4. As if ſaid, doſt thou behave thy ſelfe ſo unthankfully to God, not knowing of his goodneſſe, will thy conſcience ſay that thou art not acquainted with his goodneſſe; no, no, that is not the cauſe, it is the hardneſſe and impenitencie of thy heart, <hi>that treaſureſt up unto thy ſelfe wrath, ver.</hi> 5. And that this is ſpoken of thoſe people, that have not ſo much as the Law written vouchſafed them, otherwiſe than the effects thereof written in their hearts. See the 14 and 15 verſes following.</p>
               <p>And this need not ſeem ſtrange to any man: For behold beloved, that even Chriſts choſen Apoſtles and Diſciples, were ignorant of his ſufferings, death, and reſurrection, even after they had remained with him a conſiderable time, as appeareth in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21. By his there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them, that he muſt ſuffer, and be killed, and be raiſed againe the third day; and ſo alſo in <hi>Mark</hi> 8.31. and herewith is very much to be obſerued, that in the very time of that their great ignorance, Chriſt doth affirme directly, that they were bleſſed, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16. as alſo he affirmeth that <hi>Peter</hi> was bleſſed, even before <hi>Peter</hi> knew of Chriſts ſufferings, death and reſurrection, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. And more than this, for <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ignorant what the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the dead ſhould mean, <hi>Marke</hi> 9.10. And to prove that they were all by Chriſt affirmed to be then bleſſed, even in the time of that their ignorance, or before they knew of his ſufferings, death, and reſurrection, compare <hi>Mat.</hi> 13 16. and 16.17. foregoing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are affirmed to be bleſſed, even in the time of that their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.20, 21, 22, 23. following, wherein is made apparant, that Chriſt at that time before, when he affirmed them to be bleſſed, had not then acquainted them with his ſufferings, death, and reſurrection; and alſo that then they were utterly ignorant of thoſe particulars, therefore it is no ſtrange thing to beleeve, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens may (by the effectuall inabling means uſed with them by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in the viſible book of the Creatures) beleeve and confide in Gods goodneſſe, who raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the dead, which faith, by vertue of that name, is imputed for righteouſneſſe, as is before ſaid, although they never heard of the name of Jeſus, nor are made acquainted with the particulars of his ſufferings, death, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:152477:29"/>for moſt of the antient Saints before Chriſts Incarnation, had either none or very little knowledge of Chriſts name, and particulars of his ſufferings, death, and reſurrection, the knowledge of which particulars, now ſince Chriſts Incarnation, death and reſurrection, is required where the Goſpell comes, as main Articles of our Chriſtian Faith.</p>
               <p>And obſerve herewith yet further, that as it ſaid, <hi>the manifeſtat on of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withall,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. that though ſome men apply this Text to beleevers only, becauſe there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to beleevers, yet to teſtifie to the world, that the very heathens though not inſtructed in Chriſtian principles, have effectuall manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations uſed with them, it is ſaid that that which may be known of God, is manifeſt in them (and the reaſon is therewith given) for God hath ſhewed it unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. Which manifeſtation of the ſpirit to the Heathen, maketh the very letter of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. to appear in full for every man, and alſo amiably agreeth with that Text, where it is ſaid, that Chriſt inlightneth (no fewer than) every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into the world, ſo that (no leſſe number than) <hi>all men through him might beleeve, John</hi> 1.7, 9. Now you know that every man and all men, muſt needs include all the Heathen men; and the bookes wherewith God by his ſpirit doth teach thoſe Heathens, are alſo made known to us in the word, ſaying, <hi>For the inviſible things of him, that is, his eternall power and Godhead, are ſeen by the Creation of the world, ſo that they are without excuſe, Rom.</hi> 1.20. That whereas all men are brought to the knowledge of the truth of Gods goodneſſe, as hath been largely proved, whereby thoſe perſons of thoſe Heathens, that having the truth, do hold the truth in unrighteousneſs, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. and having the truth, do change the truth into a lye, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. ſuch of thoſe Heathens, though ſo having the knowledge of God, who is truth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.16. communicated to them, yet do not glorifie God as God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. and having the knowledge of God, doe not like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that knowledge, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. ſuch are without excuſe, as <hi>verſe</hi> 20. becauſe God hath ſhewed theſe unto them, as before, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the ſpirit in the Creature-booke; wherein note, that if the means were not an effectuall diſcovery, then in equity they were excuſable. So alſo the teſtimony of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> concerning this very point, where he alſo ſetteth forth to view, by what books God by his ſpirit doth declare himſelfe and his goodneſſe, even to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:152477:30"/>thoſe very Heathens, ſaying, <hi>the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy worke, day unto day uttereth ſpeech, night unto night ſheweth knowledge; there is no ſpeech nor language, where their voice is not heard, their line is gone through all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world, Pſal.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3. which ſort of Preaching, though Chriſts name, nor the particulars of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, death and reſurrection, be not diſcovered to them thereby, yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> from hence doth affirme it to be a Goſpell preaching to all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.18. ſaying, <hi>have they not heard? yes verily, their ſound went into all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world,</hi> alluding here to the ſame words uſed in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19. before recited; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the abuſe of this knowledge of God, cauſeth a delivering up to a reprobate minde, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.28.</p>
               <p>Now beloved, conſidering that all the Heathens are ſo effectually enabled ſpiritually, to heare, ſee, and underſtand, and confide in Gods goodneſſe, as it is proved that all men are, in my Laſt Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, take notice hereby, what pregnant ſpeaking voices, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching manifeſtations, as the Text ſaith, fitted for all languages, are communicated by Gods ſpirit by the Creatures, to every one of them, Heathens, and all the world, to make manifeſt the goodneſſe of God, to them and all other men, and in their conſcience, to cauſe them to confide therein, if they reſiſt not; alſo it is ſaid, <hi>he that beleeveth in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 4.5. Now you know <hi>it is God that justifieth, Rom.</hi> 8.33. though Chriſt be the only means of juſtification propitiatory; here alſo you ſee, that faith in God juſtifieth by Chriſt, although Chriſt by name in his performances, be not diſcovered. Againe, <hi>all Kings of the earth, and all people, are called upon to praiſe his name, Pſal.</hi> 148.11. Then certainly, although many Kings and people have not Chriſt crucified or them, revealed to them, yet there is a true reall cauſe (beſides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcountable temporall mercies) whereby they are all obliged to praiſe his name, and ability given them, whereby they may ſo doe, elſe that command were injurious, and fallacious, which is the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of blaſphemy, to affirme thoſe to be in God.</p>
               <p>But if we will be ruled by the Apoſtle, he tels us, that there is no difference between <hi>the Jew and the Greeke, for the ſame Lord over all, is rich unto all that call upon him, Rom</hi> 10.12. though Chriſts name be not diſcovered to ſome men, and though in outward Ordinances
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:152477:30"/>they differ, and this he affirmeth in a leading way, to diſcover the generall Creature, teaching in the 18 <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame Chapter, and as fully, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. Alſo our Saviour commendeth and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth men, in that ſort of beleeving in God, where the knowledge of himſelfe is not obteined, ſaying for their incouragement, that ſo confide in God,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye beleeve in God, beleeve alſo in me, John</hi> 13.1. Thus though confirming their faith which they were in, yet thereby gently inſtructing them to beleeve in him alſo, where he is made known.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>the grace of God bringeth ſalvation unto</hi> (no fewer than) <hi>all men, Tit.</hi> 2.11. and by this means aforeſaid, we find how that the Goſpell was, and is preached to every Creature that is under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, according to <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. And why ſhould the Chriſtians ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this truth? <hi>ſhall their eye be evill, becauſe God is good? Mat.</hi> 2.15. or why ſhould any Chriſtian offer to part <hi>thoſe whom God hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, in the great and good Goſpell-tidings? Luke</hi> 2.10. and in the generall bleſſing in Chriſt, promiſed often to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that in their ſeed, ſhould no fewer than all the Nations of the earth, and all the families of the earth be bleſſed.</p>
               <p>But what now beloved hath God leſt us without evident exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this his gracious dealing, even with the heathens alſo, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this Scripture Doctrine? Hath he not for our further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation therein, ſet forth <hi>Lydia,</hi> who is honoured with reſpect, to to be one that worſhipped God, even before ſhee cloſed in with the religious principles, either of the Jewes or Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. Alſo <hi>Rahab</hi> the Harlot, a Gentile, is ranked amongſt thoſe worthies, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. her faith being only a confiding in the God of Iſraels power and goodneſſe, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 2.9, 10. there being no mention of her faith in Chriſt, for ſhe was then no proſelyted Jew, much leſſe a Chriſtian. We have alſo the example of <hi>Job,</hi> and his godly friends, which were neither Jewes nor Chriſtians. Alſo the Centurion, the Roman Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, who though he was no Jew, nor then joined to the Chriſtians, yet our Saviour exceedingly commends his faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10. Alſo we have for example a woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> having alſo no knowledge of Chriſt as a Saviour, by his ſufferings, death and reſurrection, and yet our Saviour did not only approve of her faith, but rather admires at it, ſaying, <hi>O woman great is thy faith, Mat.</hi> 15.23.28.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:152477:31"/>
               <p> Alſo we have for example, <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whoſe <hi>prayers and almes same as for a memorial, before God, Acts</hi> to 4. he being then no proſely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Jew, and before he was by <hi>Peter</hi> made acquainted with the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts ſufferings, death and reſurrection: Whereupon <hi>Peter,</hi> after he was inſtructed by an efficacious viſion, that he ſhould not call any man (note) that he ſhould not call any man common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.28. then by way of admiration, he opened his mouth, and ſaid, <hi>of a truth I perceive, that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſſe, is accepted of him;</hi> hereby including any perſon in any Nation whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether they be Chriſtians or not, that fear God and worke righteouſneſſe, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was found to doe, before he was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in Chriſtianity. And further to clear Gods impartiality, amongſt very many other places, peruſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Romans</hi> 2.11. 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1, 17.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that <hi>Paul</hi> was inſtructed of God, not to call any man common or uncleane, I hope it will be a ſufficient caveat for all Chriſtians, to be wary of ſlighting or undervaluing of ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Heathens, which have been, and are, or probably may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be in the world.</p>
               <p>As if God hath not, nor doth not afford them effectuall means, whereby in their good uſe thereof, they might be eternally ſaved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not afford them the outward priviledges of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for from this number of godly Heathens by Scripture nominated, we cannot but in all probability conclude, that there hath been, is, and will be great multitudes of ſuch godly Heathen Saints, from the beginning of the world, to the end thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus, as before, I gave you a hint what Chriſt did by his perſonall performances upon the earth, by his deſcenſion from Heaven, by that ſalvation wrought in himſelf for all men to plant the foundation of the common ſalvation of all men.</p>
               <p>So now herein, I have preſented to you, a taſte of what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt hath done, and doth in men, by his being aſcended, and ſitting at his Fathers right hand, from thence by his ſpirit, finiſhing the common ſalvation of all men, whereby alſo conſidering, that all men are therein inabled with a poſſibility or ability in themſelves, whereby in their well uſage thereof, they may obtaine eternall life.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:152477:31"/>
               <p> A great part of the excellency of the reſtored ſecond life of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, by Chriſt procured, by his ſwallowing up mankinds firſt death, in victory, which came over all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, is laid open to publick view.</p>
               <p>and without this ability of grace on all men, even on them that doe chooſe darkneſſe rather than light; thoſe refuſers could neither know ſaving truth from falfhood, nor light from darkneſſe, nor could not depart from the faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. they never had, neither could any man make ſhip wrack of faith and a good conſcience, as ſome did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. and ſo their refuall of grace, would be in the ballance of juſtice and equity, excuſable,</p>
               <p>Eſpecially conſidering, that all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, is unavoidably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in an utter unability by another mans offence, even by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, unto which act they never gave any actuall or perſonall conſent, much leſſe did ever act in it, for they were all unborn. See what is ſaid of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> conſidered of as unborn, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. which is, that then they had done neither good nor evill.</p>
               <p>But hereby we finde from theſe aforeſaid apparant over-powring manifeſtations by Chriſt ſtrongly, though gratiouſly acted, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver God and his goodneſſe to all men, by bringing all men to the knowledge of the truth, proceedeth that ſaying directed to men, to perſwade them to lay hold on that ſtrength, ſaying, <hi>Let him obſerve, let him take hold of my ſtrength, that he make peace with me, and he ſhall make peace with me, Iſa.</hi> 27.5. Note that the man muſt lay hold; and from the ſame ground it is ſaid, <hi>that thoſe that forget God, ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into hell, Pſal.</hi> 9.17. <hi>Job</hi> 8.13. not ſaid thoſe that never knew God, but thoſe that after knowing, forget God, but that even the Gentiles alſo may know God in his grace, mercy and goodneſſe, <hi>Chriſt is appointed to be a light unto</hi> (even unto thoſe) <hi>the Gentiles, that he ſhould be for ſalvation</hi> (note this that he ſhould be for ſalvation, not only for Chriſtians, but alſo) <hi>unto the ends of the earth, Iſa.</hi> 49.6. This Chriſt doth by his ſpirit, by inlightning not only the heathens, but alſo every man, or all men, ſo that not only the Gentiles or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but alſo all men might beleeve, as appears, in <hi>John</hi> 1.7.9. And for this end, <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent unto the very Gentiles alſo to open their eyes, though not powerfully to turn them; but as in moſt tranſlations, that they might, or may thereby turn them from the power of Sathan unto God, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. by the means aforeſaid; faith is afforded,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152477:32"/>not only to the heathens, but alſo to all men, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. though ſome men make ſhip wracke of it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. <hi>this grace bringeth ſalvation to</hi> (no fewer than) <hi>all men, Tit.</hi> 2.11. though ſome men refuſe it, <hi>Thus is the Goſpell preached to every Creature, which is under Heaven, Col.</hi> 1.23. though ſome men reject that preaching.</p>

               <head>The eighth Diſtinction, which ſheweth the miſtakes of ſome men, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning divers very conſiderable expreſſions of Scripture, which hath bred, and doth nurſe up many vaine contentions, even amongſt Chriſtians, about the gratious extent of the common ſalvation.</head>
               <p>THE expreſſions of Scripture, which are very often by ſome men miſapplyed, are theſe (us, wee our, ye) and ſuch like; and alſo the word (many) is much wreſted; for where it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt or the Sonne of Man, came to give his life a ranſome for many, Mar.</hi> 10.45. This Text from the word many, is by ſome men applyed, as if Chriſt gave his life a ranſome for the elect only, and ſo conſequently but for ſome part of men: But what ſaith the Scripture: <hi>many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and perpetuall contempt, Dan.</hi> 12.2. Herein it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, but that the word <hi>many</hi> doth include all that ſleep in the duſt, <hi>for the grave delivereth up all that are in it to judgement, Rev.</hi> 20.13. Note here that all ſleep in the duſt, one way or other, except in the caſe of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Eliah.</hi> Againe, <hi>many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Theſe word; are ſpoken comparatively of all men, who are all in due ſeaſon called or ſent to the worke, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. by the knowledge of the truth received; only thoſe are not choſen, that then murmure at Gods gratious diſpenſations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.1, 15. And alſo thoſe words are ſpoken againe by Chriſt, of thoſe invited to the Feaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.9, 10. where the charge given unto the fetchers in, was to bring in (no fewer than as many as they could finde, and accordingly they were gathered together) all as many as they found, good and bad.</p>
               <p>This is a ſimile of Gods dealing with mankinde, and you know that God can finde out all men, to call them to the Goſpell-Feaſt, therefore conſidering, that according to the Parable, he calleth as many as he can finde, conſequently by inlightenment, he calleth no fewer than all men, as is proved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6. <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 9. Alſo by Chriſts accordingly, not only inlightning, but alſo inabling all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:152477:32"/>men, or every man to know the truth of Gods goodneſſe, and imbrace it, and confide in it, as is proved in my two laſt Diſtinctions, it doth evidently appeare, that by <hi>many are called,</hi> is included that <hi>all men art called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though through ſome mens owne wilfull defaults, when being called, and all drawn to Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 12.32. by their drawing back, few are choſen, all the reſt being of that number, that draw back to perdition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 39.</p>
               <p>So alſo it is ſaid, <hi>for as by one mans offence many were made ſinners, Rom.</hi> 5.19. and as agaire it is ſaid, <hi>if through the offence of one, many be dead, ver.</hi> 15. ſo in full ſatisfaction what the number is, which is here meant by the word <hi>many,</hi> it is ſaid in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. in the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>as by one man, ſinne entred into the world, and death by ſinne, and ſo death paſſed over all men.</hi> Here you ſee plainly, that in the word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, all men are included; for the Text ſaith, <hi>that all men were made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners by one mans offence, Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>and that thereby death paſſed over no fewer than all men. Rom.</hi> 5.12.</p>
               <p>Alſo as our Saviour Chriſt is ſaid to give his life a ranſome for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. and <hi>Marke</hi> 10.45. So to ſet forth fully, what the number is there meant by the word <hi>many,</hi> it is alſo written, that he gave himſelfe or his life, a ranſome for (no leſſe number) than all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <p>And conſidering the expreſſion (us) where it is ſaid, <hi>unto us a child is born, unto us a ſonne is given, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. Theſe words are applyed by ſome men, as if appertaining to the elect or beleevers only, which is contrary to the Scripture, for the good tidings of great Joy, which is appropriated to that holy child Jeſus being born and given, <hi>is proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Angels, to be good tidings of great joy for</hi> (no fewer perſons than) <hi>all people, Luke</hi> 2.10. And further concerning that his Son given; it is affirmed, that God out of his love to the world, gave his Sonne, and ſent his Sonne, <hi>not to condemne the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved, John</hi> 3.16, 17. And whereas ſome have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the word (world) to meane only the world of the elect or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; the Evangeliſt St <hi>John</hi> doth utterly denie that limitation, ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>and he is the propitiation for our our ſins, and not for ours</hi> (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers) <hi>only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Hereby that word <hi>only,</hi> as applyed to beleevers only, is utterly by ſtrength of Scripture, caſt out as fallaciouſly abuſive.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:152477:33"/>
               <p> And alſo if Gods giving his Sonne to the world, as in <hi>John</hi> 3.16. be applyed to elect or beleever, only, then the ſence of that Text, cannot be read any otherwiſe, than thus: That God ſo loved the world of the elect, or beleevers only, that he gave his only begotten Sonne, that whoſoever of the world of the elect or beleevers, doe beleeve in him, ſhall not periſh. But conſidering that the Scripture no where ſaith, the world of elect, nor the world of beleevers; I leave the groſſe abſurdity that is in that ſence, unto any rationall mans cenſure; hereby alſo appears evidently, the wrong that ſome men have done to that Text, where it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, according to the Scripture,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. by their applying that expreſſion (our ſinnes) as if meant of the ſinnes of beleevers only, notwithſtanding that the Scripture further ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt taſted death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. and <hi>that Christ dyed for no fewer than all,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15.</p>
               <p>And that thereby he is <hi>the propitiation for the ſinnes of the whole world,</hi> 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.2. Alſo obſerve, that this expreſſion, <hi>ye are bought with a price,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. and the 7.13. is by ſome men applyed to the elect or beleevers only, when as in truth, thoſe words doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to all men, for the price paid was for redemption or ranſome, and the price to effect both of them, was paid downe in full by Chriſts death, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.3. <hi>and therewith by his pretious blood ſhed,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. Now beloved, as the price paid hath reference to his death for redemption, there it is ſaid, <hi>he taſted death for every man, Heb</hi> 2.9. and as the price paid hath reference to his blood-ſhed, you know, <hi>that without ſhedding of blood there is no remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9.22. And accordingly the atonement or propitiation was with our Types the Jewes made, by the ſhedding of the blood of beaſts, the benefit of thoſe extended, though to all, as in their Jubilee, yet but to all the Jewes and proſelytes only. But herein we may behold the excellency of the price paid by Chriſts pretious blood-ſhed, tranſcendently ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting; for by that propitiation made, or price paid for atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Chriſt is affirmed to be the pacifying propitiation, for (no few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than) the ſins of the whole world, as hath been in other cauſes ſaid, that is for the tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. which were the ſins accounted againſt the Father, as in my next Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>And againe, as the price paid hath reference to Chriſt, as a ranſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who alwaies pays the full value appointed for the ranſomed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:152477:33"/>or in bondaged, then behold it is ſaid, <hi>he gave himſelfe a ranſome</hi> (not for elect, or beleevers, or Chriſtians only, but) <hi>for all.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. Beſides al this, becauſe no man ſhould doubt to maintaine this large extent of the price paid, the Scripture ſteps forth and tels us, that there are ſome men though bought by Chriſt, <hi>that do deny the Lord that bought them,</hi> with that price paid, and (not God, but) themſelves, do thereby bring <hi>upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. Againe, obſerve, that whereas it is ſaid, <hi>that if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne, Rom.</hi> 5.10. that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is applyed by ſome men, as appertaining to beleevers only, whereas on the contrary, the Scripture gives us to wit; <hi>that God was in Chriſt, reconciling</hi> (not elect, or beleevers, or Chriſtians only, but) <hi>the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their</hi> (the worlds) <hi>tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes unto them,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. in relation to the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. And to confirme it, that the benefit of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is to be applyed to all men, the Apoſtle as a leading ground of that ſame ſpeech, affirmeth in the 15 <hi>verſe,</hi> immediately going before, in the ſame Chapter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. that Chriſt dyed for all, beſides all this, the reconciliation being made by his death, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious blood-ſhed, is none other by a price paid, than an atonement or propitiation, the benefit whereof, as before is proved, is in the Scriptures owne words, appropriated to all men, or every man, and for the ſins of the whole world, as againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21.</p>
               <p>And beloved, if you pleaſe, you may ſee this unlimited ſence, in this very cauſe fully proved, alſo in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. being compared with <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. wherein is plainly ſhewed, that not only all men, who are Gods moſt excellent earthly Creatures, but alſo that all things, both in Heaven and in earth, are by the blood of his croſſe, reconciled to God himſelfe, by and in him, and that all men are not only gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but are alſo reconciledly gathered together in Chriſt to God, even in him, as in thoſe Texts being compared is manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Thus for inſtance, I have given you a little notice, how that the application of theſe and ſuch like words and expreſſions of Scripture, hath been, and are by ſcholaſticall gloſſes, too often drawn away from the true meaning of the Holy Ghoſt, in holy writ, which abuſe hath very much dazled the judgements of the Chriſtian world.</p>

               <head>The ninth Diſtinction doth d ſcover what thoſe ſins were, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted in Scripture, to have been the ſinnes againſt the Father, and that thoſe ſinnes alſo, were the ſame ſins, which in Scripture are called the ſinnes of the whole world, and that they are all forgiven in and by Chriſt.</head>
               <p>THey were thoſe ſins that were tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, for the releaſe of which, to all men, Chriſt ſuffered death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. Theſe ſins by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, would have brought in an eternall ſeparation of all men, from Gods bleſſed preſence, and from their off-ſpring proceeding from one man, they are called the ſin of the world, which ſin, <hi>the Lamb of God taketh away, John</hi> 1.29. and by their originall over-ſpreading leproſie, into all mankindes natures, they are called the ſins of the whole world; for which ſins alſo, Chriſt is the propitiation, <hi>John</hi> 1.29. Theſe ſins were againſt God the Father, having no incarnation with mankinds hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature; wherefore thoſe ſins could not be forgiven, without that valuable ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, therefore out of his love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, God the Father was <hi>in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing thoſe the worlds ſins unto them, but laid upon him</hi> (his son) <hi>the iniquity of us all, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. This was repreſented unto us, by the ſcape-Goat, on which, not only ſome, but all the ſins of the children of Iſrael were then put, and on him ſent away with that goat, unto a Land not inhabited, even into the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.22. or Land of oblivion; this ſignificant type, being compared with the large ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of Chriſt the Lamb, offered without blemiſh, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.12. doth ſignifie to us, that the Fathers juſtice was ſatisfied for thoſe ſins that were againſt him, at the time of his accounting and accepting of the Lamb as if ſlaine, and his pretious blood as if ſhed, which was by the Fathers fore-knowledge of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, timely fore-ordained and prepared to that very end, from or before the foundation of the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19, 20. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8. Therefore conſidering that the firſt Teſtament or Fathers Law, written in Tables of ſtone with his ſinger, on Mount <hi>Sinai. Exod.</hi> 31.18. is blotted our for all men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the firſt death aboliſhed for the benefit of all mankinde, as is proved they are in my 4 and 5 Diſtinctions. We are not to conceive, that there are many ſins remaining in the world, which are accounted
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:152477:34"/>ſinnes againſt the Father, never ſince God then virtually applyed the Lambs blood, as a timely antidote to expell the poiſon of thoſe ſinnes, even at <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
               <p>Though indeed if we look upon the union of the God-head, the leaſt ſinne is offenſive to all the Trinity as united, wherefore though all ſins, except the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are ever ſince the fall, accounted to be directly againſt him the Son of man, as diſtinct in the Trinity, <hi>all power being given to him in heaven and in earth Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>ſo that the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Sonne, Iohn</hi> 5.22. yet in his reſpect to honour the Father, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts men to pray to the Father for forgiveneſſe of ſins, <hi>that the Father may be glorified in the Sonne, Iohn</hi> 14.13.</p>
               <p>Thus we are taught by Scripture, that the ſins againſt the Father, were thoſe ſins which were againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. the eternall puniſhment of which, is aboliſhed for all men, even at the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> or at the very entrance of thoſe ſins, for if there had been the leaſt vacation, or intervallum, betwixt thoſe ſinnes then acted by <hi>Adam,</hi> and the vertuall application of Chriſt the Lambs blood, then thoſe ſins againſt the Father, by the equity of his Juſtice, being unſatisfied in that time of vacation, would have juſtly diſſolved the earth, and all the inhabitants thereof; as appeareth by <hi>Davids</hi> ſpeech in the behalfe of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.3. and by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> his affirmation of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. and by his admiration at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.18. ſee alſo <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.

               <p>OBſerve herein, that there is but two deaths, either mentioned or intimated in Scripture, not medling here with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death of the bodies of men, which is the utmoſt out-going of the power of the firſt death, which temporall death is hardly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:152477:35"/>in Scripture, the name of death, but is therein often in reſpect of the reſurrection from it, accounted but a ſleep, or change of tho body.</p>
               <p>This conſidered we ſhall finde, that though the Scripture doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a firſt death, due for the tranſgreſſions againſt the Father, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Incarnation with mankindes humane nature; which firſt death would therefore have held eternall condemning power over all men, if it had not been prevented by Chriſt, as in my firſt Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and alſo that though the Scripture, doe ſet forth a ſecond death, in and by which, ſome men doe periſh eternally, by their own wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full perſiſting in rebellion againſt the gratious dictates of the Holy Ghoſt, being God alſo, having no incarnation with makind, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: Yet note ſeriouſly, that the Scripture doth no where, neither mention nor intimate, any third death appropriated to be the executioner for mens tranſgreſſions againſt Chriſt the Sonne, or Son of man, having a fraternall incarnation with mankinds humane nature, ſin excepted.</p>
               <p>From this palpable ſilence of the Scripture in this point, and its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing ſo amiably with the Texts hereafter cited we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is no eternall death at all appropriated, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions againſt him the Sonne of man.</p>
               <p>And not only ſo, but as he hath freed all men for ever, from the danger of the eternall ſting of the firſt death, due for the tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Teſtament, and ſo againſt the Father, as is before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in Diſtinction 5. Even ſo he doth out of his love to all men, his brethren in the fleſh, ſo ſtrongly aſſiſt all mankind as is proved in my 4, 5, 6 and 7 Diſtinctions, that thereby in their wel uſage of that means, they might eſcape the eternall danger of the ſecond death, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for the ſinnes againſt he Holy Ghoſt.

Yet by the vertue of his power, purchaſed by God the Fathers ſo timely accepting of his blood, as is ſhed at <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as before ſaid, he hath been, and is inveſted with power, to forgive all the ſins that have been acted by any man, ever ſince the time of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, or ſhall be to the ends of the world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch of them as do by wilfull perſiſting in unbeleefe, prove to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſins a gainſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And therefrom he doth, as conſidering that men are ignorant of that his power, uſe, means, to heale that their ignorance, that the world may know, <hi>that the Sonne of man hath power to for give ſinnes upon earth,</hi> as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.10. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.24.

               <p>He hath power to forgive, and doth forgive, as aforeſaid, as the aforeſaid ſins of all men, as againſt himſelfe, without any oblation, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, atonement or propitiation made, to him the Sonne of man, and from thence he exhorteth all men ſo largely, often, and freely, to forgive one another their treſpaſſes, as appeareth <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.21, 22. and in the prayer he taught his Diſciples, and in <hi>Luke</hi> 17.4. Thus we finde, that all the ſins that have been, are, or are to be acted by any man, or all men, ever ſince God the Fathers virtually applying at <hi>Adams</hi> fall, the effects of Chriſts blood ſhed for all mens ſins:</p>
               <p>And from that time unto the end of the world, ſinnes againſt Chriſt only, and his in lightning, in abling, preparative worke, and that they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:152477:36"/>are all as concerning everlaſting puniſhment, all forgiven to all the ſonnes of men, excepting only our Saviour Chriſts former own excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning thoſe of them ſinnes, which are by ſome men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, rebelliouſly transformed into the ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt, by their perſiſting obſtinately and wilfully in unbeleeſe, againſt the holy ſpirits gratious teachings, which are alwaies by grace annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in due ſeaſon to our Saviours in lightning all men ſo effectually, as is proved in my 6 and 7, Diſtinctions.</p>

               <head>The eleventh Diſtinction ſheweth what thoſe ſins are, which in Scripture are accounted to be ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghost, and that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world to come, and the cauſe why, whereby the ſecond death is diſcovered alſo.</head>
               <p>OBſerve herein, conſidering that Chriſt doth inlighten every man, that commeth into the world, ſo <hi>that</hi> (no fewer than) <hi>all men through him might beleeve, John</hi> 1.7, 9. And alſo that in obedience to his Fathers will, <hi>he doth bring all men unto the knowledge of the truth,</hi> accoding to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. as is largely proved in my 6 and 7 Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And conſidering therewith, that the Apoſtle abſolutely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <hi>that if we finne wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearfull looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27 ſo that effect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6. From hence we ſee proved, that thoſe ſinnes which are ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt, are the ſinnes which ſome men doe commit againſt the holy Ghoſts teachings, after they are by Chriſt in due ſeaſon inlightned, and after they are helped to the knowledge of the truth, and whereas thoſe ſins are by Chriſt, ſaid to be unpardonable, as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.13. I find the cauſe to be, firſt, in reſpect that they are ſinnes againſt the ſecond Covenant, being the Covenant of grace; ſecondly, that they are ſins perſiſted in, againſt the ſpirit of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. its dictates and teachings, who being ſo offended, being God having no INcarnation with humanity. Theſe tranſgreſſions againſt God the Holy Ghoſt, by tranſgreſſing againſt the ſecond Teſtament, in wilfull perſiſting cannot be forgiven without a valuable ſatisfaction made to ſatisfie juſtice with.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, I finde the irrecoverable cauſe to be, becauſe there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:152477:36"/>cannot be any valuable ſatisfaction made, for men to ſatisfie juſtice for a deity offended, who hath no Incarnation with humane nature, but by one, who though being God, and one in Union in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is made capable to ſuffer death, by taking upon him humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, to conclude this cauſe, I finde, that although Chriſt being ſo made capable to ſuffer death, did dye to ſatisfie God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers juſtice, for the ſins which as an unreſiſtible violent inundation overwhelmed all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity (though ſinners in the ſeed) for ſins by him acted, without the perſonall conſent, much leſſe actuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, of any one of them, ſo preſerving all men from the curſe of the Law and firſt death, due for the tranſgreſſions againſt that Law' as in my 4 and 5 Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>Yet concerning mens owne actuall and perſonall ſinnes, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, wilfully and perſiſtingly acted againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and ſecond Covenant, after their inabſing and inlightenment, conſidering that there is none other of the Trinity but Chriſt Jeſus, capable to ſuffer death, nor any other to be found any wiſe able to make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that deity, the Holy Ghoſt ſo oftended, having as God the Father, no incarnation with humane nature;</p>
               <p>From hence proceeds the irrecoverable eternall fearfull condition of ſuch Tranſgreſſors, openly diſcovered in theſe few words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where it is ſaid, <hi>that without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9.22. and by its affirming withall, <hi>that Chriſt being raiſed from the dead dyeth no more</hi> (and that) <hi>death hath no more dominion over him, Rom.</hi> 6.9. From which cauſe, thoſe wilfull perſiſting tranſgreſſors of the ſecond Covenant, againſt God the Holy Ghoſt, muſt in juſtice unavoidably periſh in the eternall ſecond death. Thus I have briefly hinted what the ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt are, and what the cauſe is, that they are unpardonable, as appeareth alſo, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10.14, 15, 21, 8.</p>
               <p>Now beloved, if you pleaſe herewith to take farther notice of the impoſſibility of their recovery, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31, 32. and <hi>Heb</hi> 6. and ſome particulars of their eternall puniſhment diſcovered in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Jude</hi> 12. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 9.10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. I ſhall not need to make any further diſcovery, to ſhew you what the ſecond death is, which is to be a much more ſorer puniſhment then pertained to the breach of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.29.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:152477:37"/>
               <p> Only I do intreat you to take notice, that becauſe our Saviour Chriſt hath ſaid that all ſinnes and blaſphemies ſhall be forgiven, unto the ſons of men, but only the ſinnes or blaſphemies againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>That ſome men have cavilled at this our Saviours affirmation, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then all unbeleevers actuall ſins are remitted without any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe in that ſence the unbeleevers doe periſh eternally, for their unbeleefe only.</p>
               <p>They herein contrary to Scripture, ſeparating the act of unbeleefe it ſelfe, from the evill actions of men, or actuall ſins of men, wilfully perſiſted in, after inlightenment, until thoſe men prove to be of that ſort of men, that are called Goats, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.32, 33. and of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine ſeed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. their actuall ſins being alſo thereby by them transformed into the ſame nature, by their wilfully becomming the children of the Devill, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. From hence that fearfull affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſeth, that ſome men are twice dead, that were not only once dead, <hi>by that one mans offence, Rom.</hi> 5.12. by the firſt death, but though being fully ſet free by Chriſt, from the eternall danger of that firſt death, and law of works, as in my 4 and 5 Diſtinctions, they doe through their owne wilfull defaults, fall into the danger of the eternall ſecond death, for their wilfull actuall and perſonall perſiſting abuſe of grace, and ſo are twice dead; and not only ſo, but plucked up by the roots alſo, <hi>to whom is reſerved blackneſſe and darkneſſe for ever, Jude</hi> 12, 13. This is the ſecond death ſo much mentioned in Scripture, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6, 14. and elſe where.</p>
               <p>And now for the clearing the cauſe of Election and Reprobation, theſe ſix objections next following, are diſtinctly anſwered.</p>

               <head>The twelth Diſtinction, wherein the wrong application of the ſimile of the Potter and his clay is diſcovered.</head>
               <p>OBſerve herein, that whereas it is ſaid, <hi>hath not the Potter power over the Clay, of the ſame lump, to make one veſſell unto honour, and another unto diſhonour? Rom.</hi> 9.21. Wherein the miſtakes ariſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame lump herein mentioned, hath by ſome men been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, to be the whole Creature lump of mankinde, whereas in truth, God doth not challenge any more or larger prerogative to himſelfe, in that aforeſaid Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. than he doth in that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:152477:37"/>antient preſident of his, concerning the Potter and his Clay, plainly recoded in <hi>Jer</hi> 18. From which antient Scripture Grancouther, or lively deſcription, what is meant by the Potter and his Clay, that Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. is punctually derived; which antient exact plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, exemplarily doth make manifeſt unto any man in all the world, that deſire to know the truth, that by the Clay on the Potters wheel, is not meant the generall Creature Lump of all mankinde, conſidered of as in one lump, out of which one lump, God takes ſome men, and refuſes others, by his will and power only, as ſome men have vainly imagined, but that by the ſame lump, is meant as in <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. <hi>the houſe of Iſrael, vorſe</hi> 6. <hi>or the Lump of a nation-or a Kingdome, verſe.</hi> 7. <hi>or the ſeverall lumps of particular mens perſons, in their individuals, verſes</hi> 11, 12. where is much to be obſerved, however ſome godly men have overlooked this true ſenſe, that though all men were made diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable veſſels by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, yet that God hath by the Grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration, made all men honourable veſſels virtually in Chriſt by Chriſt, as appeareth, <hi>that not only all men, but all things are reconciled to God, gathered together in one in Chriſt, even in him,</hi> as by Scripture is fully proved in my 20 Diſtinction, and hath made all men, all Nations, or all families of the earth bleſſed in him, as is proved in my 21 Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and hath ſanctified all men in him, as is proved in my 22 Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and hath by reconciling the world unto himſelfe in him, by non-imputation of the worlds ſinnes unto them, juſtified all men in him vertually, from all their tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Teſtament, as is by Scripture proved; in my 22 Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>And though all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, were blotted out of Gods book of life, which came in with the Creation, yet he hath by Chriſt, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all men in his book of life againe, which came in by Chriſts reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as is by Scripture proved in my 24 Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>By this means, by him, making all men honourable veſſels, vertually in him, though no man be in himſelfe, actually and perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reconciled or bleſſed, or ſanctified, or juſtified, or doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably remaine written in Gods reſtored book of life, untill he be actually and perſonally thankfully contented with Chriſt the Potter, his ſo well forming him upon his reſtoring Potters wheele, and doe patiently abide in thankfull beleeving, and becauſe all men are unable to beleeve by nature, therefore he enableth all men to beleeve, as is proved in my 6 Diſtinction, primarily intending to preſerve all men,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152477:38"/>on his Potters wheele of reſtoration, that they being ſo by grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, might by their complyance to his well-forming hand thereon, be ſo farre honourable veſſels, as to be eternally ſaved, as is by holy writ fully proved, in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions, which I doe intreat you to peruſe. Thus it evidently appeareth, that God is ſo farre from marring any people, Nation, Kingdome, or particular perſon, before they perſiſtingly doe marre themſelves, as that on his part, his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care is ſo great over every one of them, leſt they ſhould, contrary to his gratious prime intention, marre themſelves under his gratious hand, upon his Potters wheele, and ſo by their rebellion, provoke him their gratious intending and inabling Potter, juſtly to make of them the ſame particular lumps or perſons, diſhonourable veſſels; that to prevent their marring themſelves, he by his ſpirit gratiouſly ſends his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Word, and Miniſters, and glorious crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures throughout the world, Dinſtinction 6 and 7, as he did his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Ieremy,</hi> not only to that Nation in generall, but alſo to every one of them to perſwade every one of them to turn from their evill waies; but thoſe perſons (the ſimilized clay) <hi>ſaid, we will walk after our evill deviſes, and we will every one</hi> (note) <hi>every one doe the imagination of his evill heart, as thoſe that refuſed to hearken, and did ſtop their ears at the gratious counſels of God, and</hi> (not God by reprobation, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) <hi>doe make their hearts as an adamant ſtone, leſt they ſhould heare the Law, and the words which the Lord of Hoſts hath ſent in his ſpirit, Zech.</hi> 7.12. <hi>to thoſe perſiſting rebellious people.</hi> Thus finding fault with God, not for his making them diſhonourable veſſels firſt, as ſome men have vainly imagined, but for finding fault for themſelves, with Gods care over them, and good means uſed with them; as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> did once for all men, by their, in effect, <hi>ſaying to him that ſo well formed them, why hast thou made me thus?</hi> yet no doubt God doth for gratious reproving ends, put men into many hard afflictions and conditions, which ſome men by making a wrong uſe thereof, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliouſly ſtruggle againſt God, and do wrongfully charge him to have made them diſhonourable veſſels, even in the time of his mercifull chaſtiſements, to purge and refine them. Such men the Apoſtle doth adviſe to take heed as <hi>Ieremy</hi> had done, for example to the Jewes, for feare, that though God hath made them honourable veſſels, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in his Son, as in my 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 Diſtinctions: Yet for their reſiſting or finding fault with the well-forming hand of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:152477:38"/>as <hi>Adam</hi> did; he doth then, and not till then, juſtly make of thoſe lumps of particular mens perſons, diſhonourable veſſels.</p>
               <p>Which truth is fully and particularly maintained in this ſence, in that antient patterne of the Potter and his Clay, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. And herein I do intreat you to note that if the ſame lump herein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, be taken for the whole lump of Mankinde, then behold how injurious that ſence is, both to God and man; for from thence they ſay (though I paſſe by mens groſſeſt application) that God foreſeeing all men, or that whole lump to be polluted with ſin by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, that God by his prerogative royall power, and abſolute will only, did then by preterition, paſſe by or did decree, to leave ſome men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of effectuall means, whereby they might recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the ſnare of the Devill, to which they are exhorted, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. or effectuall means intended on Gods part, whereby they in their well uſage thereof, might attaine unto eternall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Whereto conſidering, that God ſo leaving off ſome men, muſt needs be at that very time, when the other part of men were by him choſen, into his eternall favour, which time is ſaid in Scripture to be before the foundation of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. Note at that time thoſe men then ſuppoſed to be reprobated, were then as holy as thoſe that were choſen. Therefore it is ſaid, they were predeſtinated, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and his predeſtination is according as he doth foreknow that his, by him inabled Creatures, will be beleevers, as in Diſtinction 17. Thus you will finde that preterition, to be no other than a diſguiſed decreed reprobation, of ſome part of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity; for fore-ſeen ſins of theirs, which they in their future generations, ſhall be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably inforced to commit originally by another mans default: whereas God doth with indignation, utterly diſclaime and reprove that abuſive taxation, and alſo renounceth the taking of any ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt advantage againſt his poor creatures: and though throughout his word he affirmeth, that he actually forſaketh no man firſt, as is fully proved in my 16 Diſtinction; Yet ſay they, that this decree paſſed on them, even before thoſe his poor creatures had obtained a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall being, for they were all then unborne; and therefore then could not ſo much as give actuall conſent to, much leſſe perſonally act any waies in <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, which was the originall inlet of ſin; but what noiſome ſoile this unſhapen tenent, doth caſt upon the perfect
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:152477:39"/>perfection of our juſt God, faithfull Creator, and all his holy attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes? for a determination therein, I doe chearfully appeal to Gods owne ſentence, therein given for vindication of his unſpotted impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, proclaimed in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 24.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.9. Mans ſinning in the ſeed in <hi>Adam,</hi> is not counted to be actuall or perſonall ſinne, ſee this proved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.</p>
               <p>But now beloved, if we on the contrary part agreeable with <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.19. From whence <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. hath its lively nouriſhment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Potter and his Clay, and doe accordingly to thoſe Texts take the ſame lump therein mentioned, to be the particular lump of a Kingdom, Nation, City, Towne, or particular perſon, formerly put into a good condition vertually in Chriſt, as is proved in my 1 and 2 and 21 and 22 and 23 Diſtinctions. And t hat God though he doth create the evill of puniſhment, as men by naturall light account it, for their doing evilly, and thus fitting of themſelves to be made veſſels of wrath, as in <hi>ver.</hi> 32. yet that he neither doth, nor indeed can make any evill veſſels, or originally diſhonorable veſſels, without reſpect to ſinne firſt acted perſonally by man; for it is thereto affirmed, that they procured their evil to themſelves, not becauſe God forſook them firſt, or before <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity had actually or perſonally ſinned, as is cleared in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.18, 19. and largely in the latter end of my 16 Diſtinction before mentioned, but for that they forſooke the Lord their God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.17. firſt, and that actually alſo, as is ſaid to the ſame effect, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.19. and 18.4. Now when men, though formerly ſo well formed and inlightned, have marred themſelves upon his gratious intending Potters wheele, by their owne wilfull perſiſting in reſiſtance againſt grace, and finding fault with his good forme put on them; Then God may juſtly of the very ſame lump of every one, ſuch particular perſon make diſhonorable veſſels: Here to take notice what God ſaith in this very point, to thoſe people, the ſimilized Clay, typically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting every mans condition in this cauſe, as is proved in my 2 Diſtinction, where he affirmeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I had</hi> (for my part) <hi>planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right ſeed, how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine unto me? Ier.</hi> 2.21.</p>
               <p>Thus the honour of God, and all his holy attributes united, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the tormentors of the Text confuted; thus is ſhewed, that no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:152477:39"/>man, though by God made a diſhonourable veſſell, is wronged, and the amiable agreement of the Scripture is confirmed.</p>

               <head>The thirteenth Distinction, wherein the miſtakes of ſome men, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods dealing with <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> is laid open.</head>
               <p>HErein note, that becauſe God ſaith, <hi>for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evill, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth; it was ſaid unto her, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger, Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. From this Text, ſome men, to maintaine that Gods abſolute will, and prerogative power, is the only originall cauſe of election and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprobation, have concluded, that God did love <hi>Iacob,</hi> and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batingly hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> before either <hi>Iacob</hi> or <hi>Eſau</hi> were born, or had done either good or evill; which affirmation is by that very Text it ſelfe, proved falſe; for I am very confident that no man will affirme that, becauſe God ſaid, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that God hated the elder to eternall deſtruction as they conceive, no doubt but that God might declare that ſuch a ſervitude was to come, and yet not ſo hate the elder.</p>
               <p>Therefore obſerve how this Text hath been miſtaken; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, as the Text declares Gods word to <hi>Rebecca</hi> their mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were born, to be no expreſſe indignation of God, but only a diſcovery of a ſecret that was to come, that the one of thoſe twins ſhould be mightier than the other, <hi>and that the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, Gen</hi> 25.23. ſo it is in the Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.12. that God ſaid no other, nor expreſſed any other hatred of his at all, concerning <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born, but only declared that in future, the elder ſhould ſerve the younger, which ſo fell out in their off-ſpring.</p>
               <p>This ſervitude was all the hatred that God ſpake of concerning <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau,</hi> at any time before he was born; and as for thoſe following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in <hi>ver.</hi> 13. where it is ſaid, <hi>as it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated;</hi> which words are brought forth by ſome men, <hi>Goliath</hi>-like, to maintaine that God doth reprobate ſome men, by his meer prerogative will and power only. But I pray you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved obſerve, what ſtrength is in that ſuppoſition; for ſome men have conceived, that God did ſpeak thoſe words, to ſet forth his decreed intention concerning <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> before they were born; whereas
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:152477:40"/>in truth, God did not apply thoſe words to either of them before they were born, but are words which God ſpake to the Prophet <hi>Malachy, Mal.</hi> 1.2. many hundred of years after <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were born, in which long ſpace of time, God had a full proofe of <hi>Eſaus</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all malice againſt his bother <hi>Iacob,</hi> and of <hi>Eſaus</hi> prophaneneſſe in his ſelling his birth-right, and of the manifold perſonall injuries, that <hi>Eſaus</hi> poſterity, in that long time, had deſpitefully acted againſt the off-ſpring of <hi>Iacob,</hi> as amongſt other things, appeareth in <hi>Num.</hi> 20.17. <hi>Obad.</hi> 1. and 21. and other places. Then, and not while then, God after his ſo long experience of <hi>Eſau</hi> and his poſterities actuall and perſonall evill behaviour, both againſt himſelfe and his people, he putteth the queſtion to <hi>Malachi,</hi> ſaying, <hi>was not</hi> Eſau Jacobs <hi>brother, yet I loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>and laid his mountaines and his heritage waſte, Mal.</hi> 1.2, 3. but why ſo? was it becauſe God by preterition had left him firſt, without any hope of ſaving means, or had, as theſe people conceive, reprobated him before he was born, or before he had done good or evill? no ſuch matter; but ſaith God, <hi>becauſe of his hatred and ſhedding the blood of the children of Iſrael, Eze.</hi> 35.5. Hereby ſignifying to the Jewes, that as <hi>Eſaus</hi> wickedneſſe could not eſcape puniſhment by his being brother to <hi>Iacob,</hi> who was ſo wel beloved; ſo their wickedneſſe could not be ſheltred from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by their glorying we have <hi>Abraham</hi> to our Father; ſo at leaſt reſting in the Covenant of works, as the Apoſtle inſtanceth in that ſame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8, 11. hereby you may ſee, how far diſtant God was off to hat <hi>Eſau</hi> as eternally deſtructive, before he was born, or had done good or evill.</p>
               <p>Againe, the Scripture fully confuteth that aforeſaid tenent; for whereas you take Gods being ſaid to hate <hi>Eſau,</hi> to be no leſſe then eternall reprobation or preterition, the Scripture divers times ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders hatred, to be but a leſſer degree of love, as amongſt other places, plainly appears, by comparing <hi>Ge.</hi> 29.30. with the next verſe following, and by comparing <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.37. And to apply this to <hi>Eſaus</hi> condition you may ſee, that notwithſtanding, that his inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate eternally deſtructive hatred to <hi>Eſau,</hi> which you without any grounds imagine, yet out of his tender care to <hi>Eſau,</hi> and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, even after they had perſonally rebelled, yet he gave ſpeciall charge to <hi>Moſes</hi> in his march towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> that they ſhould not wrong no, not ſo much as any wayes provoke the children of <hi>Eſau</hi> in their poſſeſſions, <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.4, 8.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:152477:40"/>
               <p> The refore that falſe ſurmiſe, that God did everlaſtingly diſtructive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate <hi>Eſau</hi> before he was born, ſo that thereby he could not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or perſonally doe any good, doth prove utterly fallacious; for you cannot prove that God actually forſaketh any one man firſt, before they actually forſake him, for the Scripture frequently maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the contrary, as is by Scripture fully proved in my laſt and 16 Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions.</p>
               <p>Then thereto conſidering, that the Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. doth in no ſort expreſſe any everlaſting hatred, but only an earthly temporall ſervitude, which is all the hatred concerning <hi>Eſau,</hi> that ever God ſpake of at any time, to any perſon, as before <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> were born, and that the Scripture uſeth the word hate or hatred, when meaning a leſſer degree of love only, as is herein proved.</p>
               <p>And that God never mentioned any ſort of hatred towards <hi>Eſau,</hi> by the name of hatred, no, not ſo much as in temporall effects, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God ſpake of it to <hi>Malachi, Mal.</hi> 1. after he had many hundred years of experience of <hi>Eſaus</hi> perſonall and actuall malice and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of his poſterities actuall tyrannicall dealings with <hi>Jacobs</hi> poſterity; as alſo in <hi>Obad.</hi> And conſidering that accordingly the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſerved for <hi>Jacob,</hi> in that very Text mentioned, extends no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the utmoſt effects, but to an earthly temporall ſuperiority over <hi>Eſau,</hi> or his poſterity; and alſo, that the ſurmiſed reprobation wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted from <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 12. is in that very text declared by the Holy Ghoſt, to be in the utmoſt effects, but an earthly, and ſo a temporall ſervitude of <hi>Eſau</hi> to <hi>Jacob;</hi> and alſo conſidering that God predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates or rejecteth men, according to his fore-knowledge of mens qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications, ariſing from their well, or evill perſonall actings in the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity by grace given them in the common ſalvation, as is proved he doth, in my 17, and 18 Diſtinctions, it doth manifeſtly appear, that God in your ſence, hateth no one man, nor forſaketh any one man, untill a juſt cauſe be firſt given, wilfully, perſiſtingly, actually and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally by that man; but for the further diſcoverie of the fallacies, which men have put upon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. I pray you to peruſe my 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. ſhort diſtinctions, ſo much the rather, becauſe God on the contrary doth affirme, that he is (not only good, but) good to all (and that not only his mercies, but) alſo his tender mercies are over (not only ſome, but over) all his works, and that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.</p>

               <p>FRom this Text ſome men have conceived, that God by an Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power, by his ſhewing mercy, over-powreth ſome men, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looking upon them as Creatures only, ſo that thoſe perſons, neither ſhall, nor can avoid it, but they ſhall eternally be ſaved, whereas the Text ſheweth, that it is not in any mans naturall running or willing, but only in Gods mercy, who in mercy by Chriſt, to ſatisfie juſtice, hath provided a way whereby he may ſhew mercy to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and by him then doth in mercy by an Almighty power in a common ſalvation, compell all to receive ability in themſelves by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement of their will, that thereby, in their well uſage of that abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſo by Gods mercy freely given them, they may obtain eternall life, as is proved in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>Hereto in the firſt place, we are to take notice, that no one meer man can, will, or runne acceptable in Gods accompt, any wiſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to eternall ſalvation, as he is naturally deſcended from polluted <hi>Adams</hi> loines; for on the contrary, in him the will and affections being ruled by the naturall ſathanically deluded judgement, doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the wiſedome of the world, which is ſo farre from Gods impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of righteouſneſſe thereto, <hi>that the wiſdome of this world is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe with God,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19. <hi>and enmity with God, James</hi> 4.4. in this ſenſe it is impoſſible that imputation of righteouſneſſe, ſhould be ſetled upon him, that ſo willeth or runneth, how induſtrious ſoever he be, for he is yet in the ſnare of the Devill, and is taken captive at his will, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. therefore in this condition, it is no way of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but in God only that ſheweth mercy, who in mercy ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten ſonne unto the world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. who inlightneth (not only ſome men) but every man, ſo that through him all men might beleeve, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.7, 9. So by free mercy inveſting all men with an ability or poſſibility in themſelves, to be eternally ſaved, which poſſibility <hi>Adam</hi> loſt for all; ſee Diſtinct 6 and 7.</p>
               <p>Thus Chriſt was not ſent to condemne the world, but in Gods
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:152477:41"/>mercy, that the world through him (by their well uſage of that abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might will and run acceptably) and might be ſaved, compare <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 9. with <hi>John</hi> 3.17. Thus it is only of God that ſheweth and diſpenſeth this his mercy, in freely giving ability to all men by Chriſt, and from this large diſtribution of ability, their owne acting therein is expected and called for, for from this ground God commandeth (no fewer than) all men every w here to repent, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. and to purge themſelves, to put off the old man, and to put on the new man, to work out their own ſalvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12. and many ſuch like commands are given unto all men.</p>
               <p>And the incouragement is therewith given, ſaying, <hi>for it is God that worketh in your (the ability) both to will and to doe,</hi> even to all men, as it is proved in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions, and that of his good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. or by his freely ſhewing mercy, according to this Text. Secondly, we are herewith to take ſpeciall notice, that even the wils and affections of thoſe men, which by their well acting in that abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or infranchiſement, ſo by mercy given them, doe abide in belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that in thoſe very beleevers alſo, their affections, faith and works, are all imperfect; ſo that it is not any of their willings or runnings neither, that deſerveth mercy; no no: For if God ſhould take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the imperfections that are in their ſtrongeſt faith, and moſt exact obedience, to marke the iniquity of theirs that is therein, who ſhall ſtand? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.3. And this was ſpoken by a beleever, to beleevers, ſaying, <hi>if we ſay we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.8. Therefore even in the very beleevers, ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo is not of him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God only that ſheweth mercy, as before. Firſt, in providing a way in mercy by Chriſt to doe ſo, by his pacifying the Fathers juſtice. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as before, by giving ability to all men. Thirdly, by paſſing by the imperfections even of abiding beleevers by free mercy. Fourthly, by his free mercy manifeſted by his giving of his Sonne, to, and for mankinde, not only in all theſe and the like, but alſo therefrom eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing abiding beleevers in the ſpeciall ſalvation in due ſeaſon, though they doe not merit it, but as is by mercy granted for Chriſts ſake.</p>
               <p>Yet further obſerve, that conſidering, that it is Gods act in them, to inable all men, by ſetting all mens wils free, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure, or of his free mercy, as is proved he doth in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions; that thoſe men that do humbly act with God
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:152477:42"/>in that ability by mercy given them, ſtrivingly indeavouring thereby by faith, to be obedient to God, retaining alwaies the ſence of their unworthineſſe and unprofitableneſſe; Theſe men though they be in themſelves ungodly, yet God is pleaſed, according to the ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by his free mercy eſtabliſhed, to impute righteouſneſſe to theſe men, that doe beleeve in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. And ſo herein is not the leaſt tincture of any cauſe, why any ſuch, by imputation accepted beleever, ſhould boaſt or glory before God, otherwiſe than in the living uſe of his abundant mercy.</p>
               <p>Becauſe thoſe beleevers cannot but know, and alſo faithfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to the glory of Gods mercy, that they have done, do, nor can do, any thing ſavingly acceptable to God, by any ability whatſoever, but what they have in mercy received from God, and are notwithſtanding ſo far from performing their obliged duty, as that they are therein un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants, according to our Saviours direction, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. although God in mercy is pleaſed by Chriſt, to account them worthy, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.41. Thus you ſee, that in the very condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of abiding beleevers, that it is not of him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy. Therefore impoſſible to men that remaine in unbeleefe to beſaved by their willing and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, how earneſt ſoever, conſidering that they alſo are by Gods will inabled by beleeving, to will and run acceptably, but they perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly will not.

               <head>The fifteenth Diſtinction, wherein the miſtake is diſcovered, which ſome men have faſtned on that Text, where it is ſaid, <hi>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> Rom. <hi>9.18.</hi> and alſo ſheweth, that there is but one will in God.</head>
               <p>HErein to avoid miſconceptions, we are to know, that whereas it is ſaid, or ſuppoſed ſpoken, who hath reſiſted his will? <hi>ver.</hi> 19. that there is one will in God, no diſtinction of wils in God, as ſome men have imagined, that is his ſecret will, and his revealed will, his abſolute will, and his conditionall will, <hi>for God worketh all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne will, Eph.</hi> 1.11. not according to his wils, but his will, the act of Creation, and all the glorious various diſpenſations of his providence, proceedeth from the counſell of that his one will, it is his owne one and abſolute will, that ſome of his works ſhall be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:152477:42"/>ſecret, and that ſome of them ſhall be revealed, ſome abſolute, ſome conditionall, and though ſome men are ſaid to be reſiſters, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51.</p>
               <p>Yet it is not ſo much as the leaſt turning aſide of the effects and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of the counſell of that one will of God; for as all men are by the counſell of that one will of God, by grace enabled to know the truth, and accept of grace, as is proved they are all, in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions: So the effects proceeding from that one will of God, doth uncontrolably proceed directly on in its fixed courſe, and deales with every man, as he finds him perſiſting in obedience or diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to the Goſpell-condition, and that his one will doth diſpoſe of every man accordingly. Therefore we are in this cauſe now in hand, ſeriouſly to conſider of the two maine diſpenſations, proceeding from that his one will, concerning mans ſalvation, for the counſell of his one will was at the Creation, to propound to man, his ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Creature, a Covenant of works, and if he failed in performance of that condition, then to apply a propitiation before provided to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his juſtice, for that offence or tranſgreſſion againſt the firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. for all men, as is many waies proved in this tract.</p>
               <p>And alſo in purſuance to perform the further effects, proceeding from that his one will, he then alſo determined (that upon his acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on of that ſatisfaction made by Chriſt, by that unſported Lamb prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the foundation of the world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19, 20. and by him accounted of, as if ſlain from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.9. to propound a new conditionall Covenant to all men, which is; <hi>that he that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved, and that he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned, Mark</hi> 16.16.</p>
               <p>Now beloved, we are in rightly apprehending the true ſence of this Text. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. to look upon the one will of God, as it is by his own determinate counſell, to be by Chriſt diſpenſed, ever ſince the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before mentioned, accordingly as men do beleeve or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve. Alſo note, that though it be ſaid, that he that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved, yet you know, or ought to know, that all beleevers, during this life, are in themſelves unworthy, their faith and works are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect; and though their imperfections are ſuch, by the inhabitation of the remainders of the old man in them, that men indeed conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of themſelves, as in themſelves, may admire why God ſhould be
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:152477:43"/>merciful unto them; yet as his ſecond Covenant was eſtabliſhed by that his one will, ſo according to that his Covenant of grace, he will have mercy on all ſuch men (though unworthy in themſelves) as by faithfull indeavours, doe humbly aime at the performance of that his condition annexed to the ſecond Covenant, as is fully proved in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. <hi>Heb</hi> 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>James</hi> 2.5.

               <p>Yet that he hath as you conceive, in effect in this text declared that his ſecret mentall reſerve, is to proceed by his power and will only, to harden ſome men to eternall deſtruction, without any reſpect of their actuall and perſonall diſobedience againſt the Goſpell-Covenant, though ſo propounded to them by himſelfe.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:152477:44"/>that the people of the Jews, would in future forſake him, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their hearts againſt him, even unto the height of Idolatry, and told <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo; yet it is very obſervable, that God on his part, in love, uſed preventing means with them, by his word declared, and daily mercies extended unto them, and did not forſake them, untill the very time, or that very day, as the Text ſaith, in which they actually forſook him firſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.15, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>And hereto you cannot chooſe but know, that throughout the Scripture, that although God doth foreknow, what men will in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doe, yet he neither beſtowes his rewards, except inabling ones, nor actually executes his judgements, except gratious teaching ones, untill the very time that men are either actually obedient, or perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly and actually diſobedient to the Goſpell Covenant; beſides, to conclude this point, I intreat you to beare in minde, what blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous deſperate reſolutions, and fearfull effects, this their tenent may, and often doth, beget in the hearts of men, thus deluſively to tell them, that God by his power and will only, doth harden all mens hearts firſt, that ever hardned, whether they doe harden their owne hearts firſt, or not.</p>

               <head>The ſeventeenth Diſtinction is, to rectifie ſome mens miſtakes of that Text, where it is ſaid, <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate,</hi> Rom. <hi>8.29.</hi> and of that Text, where it is ſaid, <hi>elect according to the fore-knowledge of God, 1</hi> Pet. <hi>1.2.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>COncerning theſe Texts, we are to obſerve, that the very Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. doth lead us to take notice of ſomething before ſpoken, to be the cauſe of Gods predeſtinating, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his fore-knowledge, and looking back but to the very next verſe, we finde, that the Apoſtle affirmeth to, and for thoſe Roman Saints, ſaying, <hi>we known that all things work together for the beſt, unto them that love God, ver.</hi> 28. And therefore from theſe words, let us conſider what the object is upon which his foreknowledge doth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, by which he doth predeſtinate; if you ſay that God predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates only ſome men meerly, as Creatures, then his power and will ſo inordinately exalted, without his other holy attributes annexed, will render all his Goſpell-conditions, which are in point of acceptation, required to be performed of all men, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. to be abſurd and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:152477:45"/>ridiculous; what ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we ſay that his predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceedeth, accordingly as men are of more noble Parentage then ſome others? no, theſe are denyed, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 1.26. <hi>James</hi> 2.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>What then, is it in reſpect of Gods fore-knowledge of ſome men, as bred up in the moſt famous Kingdomes or Nations? no, for in this very reſpect, <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>that God is no reſpecter of perſons, Acts</hi> 10.34. What then ſhall we ſay, that God predeſtinates according to his fore-knowledge of ſome mens qualifications, in fearing God, and working righteouſneſſe (by their well acting in their infranchiſement?) to this the Scripture anſwereth chearfully, yes; for in this reſpect, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> abſolutely concludeth, even with admiration, ſaying, <hi>of a truth I perceive, that God is no reſpecter of perſons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſſe, is accepted of him, Acts</hi> 10.34, 35. and as for the tranſcendent benefits, that proceed from that his foreknowing men, we have them expreſly related in the 29, 30, verſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. to be in relation to ſuch lovers of God, leadingly ſet forth in the 18 <hi>verſe</hi> preceding in the very ſame Chapter.</p>
               <p>Thus we finde, that Gods predeſtination, and other gratious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, doe conjunctively worke together for the beſt (it is not ſaid to thoſe whom he predeſtinated by his will and power only) no, no ſuch matter, but unto thoſe that love God, as the lively coherence of that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. and 29 <hi>verſes</hi> confirmeth. Thoſe fore-known lovers of God, are thoſe objects, or thoſe men, which are ſaid to be elect, according to the fore-knowledge of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. and in further confirmation of this truth, behold that Gods gratious prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, proceedeth from Gods fore-knowing of mens actuall firſt truſting in Chriſt, and that God doth not actually ſeale men with his holy ſpirit of promiſe, untill after their actuall beleeving.</p>
               <p>To prove the firſt of theſe, its ſaid, <hi>in whom alſo we have obteined an inheritance, being predeſtinated,</hi> note this being predeſtinated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the purpoſe of him, who worketh all things after the counſell of his owne will (See here what the counſell of his will is) that that we ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 12. Note this, who firſt truſted in Chriſt, or that we which before beleeved in Chriſt, ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory, as ſome tranſlations render it. See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Know that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelfe.</hi> See alſo <hi>John</hi> 6.40. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10, 12.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:152477:45"/>2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. So that hereby appeareth plainly; that Gods grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous predeſtination of men, proceedeth from his fore-knowing them firſt to be truſters in Chriſt, where the Goſpell comes, or ſuch as doe truſt in Gods goodneſſe only, where the written Goſpell is not vouchſafed, as is proved in my 7 Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>And as for beleeving, it is not ſaid, after you were ſealed yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, but flat contrary (note this) <hi>after yee beleeved ye were ſealed with the ſpirit of promiſe, Eph.</hi> 1.13. for in truth, their beleeving eſtates them to be in perſon, imputatively in Chriſt, and they, and only they, are thereby, by their foreknowne abiding in him, thoſe men which are choſen in him before the foundation of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſubmiſſive abiding beleevers and truſters, are after their actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and perſonall beleeving and truſting in Chriſt, in Gods foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by him predeſtinated before time, to adoption of children in time, yet ſtill according to the counſell of Gods will, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. by Chriſt, although in themſelves ungodly and undeſerving ones, as is proved in my 14 and 15 Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſome men will ſay hereto, that if God doth by Chriſt, only ſet all mens wils free, and ſo only enable all men to beleeve, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in beleeving, and doth further by an almighty power, over power ſome men to beleeve, and to abide in beleeving, but then leaves it to their will, as he did to <hi>Adam</hi> our publick pattern.</p>
               <p>Then God at all adventure, did commit his dearely beloved Sonne to ſuffer death for all men, not being ſure that any one of them would accept of any benefit there-from, ſo that God was not ſure, that the glory of his mercy ſhould be magnified by any of the ſonnes of men, and ſo you by this your tenent in this reſpect, ſay, Chriſt might have ſuffered his agonies and torments of death in vain.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that Gods mercies aforeſaid, would have been magnified in all men, although all men had refuſed it.</p>
               <p>And for example herein, note, that even thoſe that doe refuſe that mercy purchaſed for they by Chriſt, ſhall one day bow the knee to him, and not only thoſe that do beleeve in him, but every tongue ſhal confeſſe (even thoſe that in this life time, will not that Chriſt ſhould reigne over them by his ſpirit) <hi>Luke</hi> 18.14. ſhall confeſſe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Lord, to the glory of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. for the (wilfull) unbeleefe of men, ſhall not make the faith (or faithfulneſſe of Gods
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152477:46"/>intentions towards them) without effect, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. for God ſhall be juſtified (of all men) when he is judged, <hi>Romans</hi> 4.26. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51.4.</p>
               <p>And in this point, <hi>the unrighteouſneſſe of men ſhall commend the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of God, Rom.</hi> 3.5. becauſe his operations, to, for, and in them, were really and gratiously intended for their ſalvation, though they have abuſed his mercy; and the Apoſtle to this end affirmeth, if wee beleeve not, yet he abideth faithfull, he cannot deny himſelfe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. which I pray obſerve: Thus we finde, that whether men do make good uſe of Gods mercies or not, which as the golden Scepter is holden forth to all men, yet not only all men, but according to Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. all the glorious Hoſt of Heaven, ſhall or will glorifie God, not only in his juſtice, but alſo for his faithfulneſs on his part, gratiouſly intended, and accordingly extended forth to all men or every man.</p>
               <p>You know beloved, that though God did fore-know, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that fell, would abuſe his mercy, yet he eſtated them in his mercy, and alſo inabled them to remaine therein, and he diſpoſſeſt not them of that bleſſed eſtate, but it was they that kept not their firſt eſtate, and left their own habitation, <hi>Jude</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>You know alſo, that God did fore-know, that <hi>Adam</hi> would not continue in his grace and goodneſſe extended unto him by Creation, yet you ſee that God proceeded on, and did Create the world for Mankinds uſe, and alſo gave <hi>Adam</hi> power to keep that his firſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed eſtate, and forſook not him, untill he forſook God firſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no ſtrange thing that God proceeded on, and did by Chriſts performances, eſtabliſh the reſtoration of all men in inabling them in the inward man, though he did foreknow that ſome men, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſed and inabled by the reſtoration, would reject his mercy purchaſed therein for them by Chriſt. But in further anſwer know, that although <hi>Adam</hi> did rebelliouſly refuſe to continue in Gods grace of Creation, yet accordinly as hath been proved, that as all men are inabled by Chriſt; ſo God did fore-know, that ſome men would by that ability given them, by their well uſage thereof, accept of, and abide in his mercy by Chriſt procured for all, and did fore-know that ſome men would chearfully yield obedience to the faith, ſo that I hope you ſhall not need to be further troubled with that fallacious feare; thus knowing, that God runs not into any hazard in anything
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152477:46"/>that he hath done, doth, or ever will doe, or ſuffer to be done: Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve herewith, that Gods foreknowledge of what mankinde the Creature will in future doe, puts no neceſſity upon any man ſo to doe, but leaveth all men after inablement, in a voluntary eſtate by reſtoration as our grand patterne <hi>ADAM</hi> was left by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <head>The eighteenth Diſtinction is a ſhort application of theſe laſt ſix Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for further clearing the cauſe of election and reprobation.</head>
               <p>FOR the diſcovery of Election and Reprobation, and what is the cauſe of them if it pleaſe you we will take a little review of what to that purpoſe hath been ſaid, in my laſt ſix Diſtinctions. In my twelfth Diſtinction, which is concerning the Potter and his Clay, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that God maketh no diſhonourable veſſels, unleſſe it be by way of juſt puniſhment, for marring of themſelves under his well-intending forming hand, and that God doth ſharpely reprove ſuch men, that do charge him to make an imperfect work, or diſmembred one, or a work that is worth nothing, as ſome tranſlations have it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.9. and alſo it is therein proved, that <hi>Jeremy</hi> plainly ſetteth forth, that by that one lump or ſame lump, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. It is not meant the one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lump of all mankinde, as ſome men fallaciouſly, to maintaine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reprobation would have it, but that by that one or ſame lump is meant, the particular lumps of ſeverall Kingdomes, diſtinguiſhed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and particular perſons, which God hath on his part firſt by Chriſt put into a good condition, and would upon his Potters wheel, by good meanes uſed with them, under his well intending hand, ſo preſerve them for ever, if they the Clay, do not perſiſt in reſiſting his good intent, finding fault of and for themſelves, with his good form put on them by reſtoration, as <hi>Adam</hi> did for all at the bleſſed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in effect, complaining againſt the former good, <hi>why haſt thou made me thus to be governed by thee, and to depend on thee? no, I will doe the abomination of my evil heart,</hi> as thoſe very men, the Clay, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their gratious exhorting Potter, as amongſt many places, ſo in <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.12. wherein the originall deſcription of the Potter and his Clay is recorded, from whence <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.21. is derived, and that God doth not forſake any one man, before that man doth actually and perſonally forſake him firſt.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:152477:47"/>
               <p> And conſidering that it is proved in my 13 Diſtinction, that God doth no where ſay, that before <hi>Eſau</hi> was born, he hated <hi>Eſau</hi> with an eternall hatred; but that expreſſion of hatred, is only a recitall of what God did ſpeake to <hi>Malachi</hi> concerning <hi>Eſau,</hi> many hundred of years after <hi>Eſau</hi> was born, in which long proceſſe of time, God had received long and exact experience, not only of <hi>Eſau's</hi> prophaneneſſe, but alſo of all his perſonall and his poſterities tyrannicall injurious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, both to himſelfe and the poſterity of <hi>Jacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that the expreſſion of God, concerning his hatred of <hi>Eſau,</hi> mentioned in <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2, 3. was but exemplary to ſhew, that no mans wickedneſſe ſhall be ſheltred from Gods indignation, by his having to his parent, or brother, or kinſman, ſuch a perſon whom God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
               <p>And that ſometimes in Scripture-phraſe, hatred is but the expreſſion of a leſſer degree of love, as there in that ſaying, <hi>the elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And conſidering, that Gods hatred in their ſence, as applyed to mans eternall reprobation or preterition, is ſo deſtructively oppoſite to Gods owne words, that he is not willing that any ſhould periſh, <hi>but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. and that he deſires not, or delighteth not in the death of him that dieth, <hi>but exhorteth them to turn themſelves and live, Ezck.</hi> 18.32. and that he is good to all, <hi>and that his tender mercies</hi> (are not onely over ſome, but) <hi>over all his works, Pſal.</hi> 145.9.</p>
               <p>And that quite contrary to their imagined conceipt, that God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh ſome men eternally, before, after their infranchiſement, they actually forſake him, God affirmeth that he doth not willingly afflict (no nor ſo much as) grieveth the children of men, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33. Why then ſhould not we beleeve God rather than men, conſidering the election and hatred there mentioned, extends but to an earthly ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority for <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a temporall ſervitude for <hi>Eſau?</hi> and that their fancied preterition from reall means, before men doe actually and perſonally forſake God, is in truth, if ript open, but a diſguiſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, for one that hath power to doe it, and doth keep from a man his food, may as really kill that man ſo, as if he cut off his head with a ſword.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that it is proved by Scripture in my 14 Diſtinction, that it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth in that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152477:47"/>darkneſſe, or by that ability, which he hath by generation naturally, from fallen <hi>Adams</hi> loines, but of God who doth ſet free all mens wils in due ſeaſon, and ſo doth enable all men by his free grace, that they by their well uſage of that ability, may acceptably by imputation, will and runne by their beleeving.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that even then alſo, it is of God that ſheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy even to beleevers, in mercy by Chriſt opening a way for it, and then in mercy forgiving their imperfections, both in their faith, and in their works alſo.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that even beleevers are in themſelves ungodly, it is only of God that ſheweth mercy; it is of him that will have it ſo, according to his ſecond Covenant, in that he doth predeſtinate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne purpoſe, who worketh all things after the counſell of his own will (not that thoſe predeſtinated by his abſolute will and power only, ſhould) but that thoſe who in his fore-knowledge, firſt truſted in Chriſt, or before beleeved in Chriſt (as ſome tranſlations have it) or fore-known lovers of God, ſhould be to the praiſ of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that thoſe men ſhould be ſealed with the holy ſpirit of promiſe (not before by Gods abſolute will and power only) but after they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, as the coherence of the Text in plain words rendereth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13. Thus God will have mercy on him, and will impute his faith for righteouſneſſe, that maketh war againſt ſinne; and yet in the lively apprehenſion of his owne ungodlineſſe, departeth not from the goodneſſe of the living God, but confidingly doth beleeve in him that juſtifieth the ungodly, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. So by thoſe Scripture-teſtimonies, ſpunging out that groſſe deluſive conſtruction, from that Text derived, that God will have mercy on ſome men, and will harden the reſidue of men, conſidered of as Creatures only, as by his abſolute will and power only, or for fore-known ſin before men do, or can, actually or perſonally forſake him.</p>
               <p>And conſidering of the ſame impartiality of our faithfull Creator, concerning his equall and juſt dealing with all men, according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17. as is proved in my 15 Diſtinction, and that their mentally conceal'd partiality of God, doth deſtroy his Goſpell-grace publiſhed, which is according to mens performances of his conditions annexed thereto, by them to be obtained.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that it is proved by Scripture in my 16 Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that God hardneth no mans heart, before he hath perſiſted in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:152477:48"/>hardning his owne heart, and that the very Idolatrous Philiſtines, to the ſhame of ſome Chriſtians, did apply <hi>Pharaohs</hi> and his peoples mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to be by himſelfe brought upon himſelf juſtly, by his and his peoples hardning of their own hearts firſt as exemplary concerning all men ſo perſiſting.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that it is proved in my 17 Diſtinction, that God doth predeſtinate ſome men to bee conformed to the image of his Sonne, but not according to his abſolute will and power only, nor as he fore-knoweth men to be of more noble parentage, nor as being more wealthy, nor as being born in more famous Kingdomes, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than ſome others are, nor meerly as Creatures, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving reſpect in his fore-knowledge, either to their doing good or bad; but that the Scripture affirmeth, that God predeſtinates according as he fore-knoweth men to belovers of God, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and that in every Nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is accepted of him, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.34, 35.</p>
               <p>And moreover conſidering, that God doth chooſe no man but in Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. then you know that no man is in Chriſt actually by imputation, untill he be an actuall beleever, therefore he chooſeth none to ſalvation, but ſuch as either are, or he fore-knoweth, will in future be in Chriſt by actuall beleeving; for it is manifeſt, that though God doth chooſe or ſet apart ſome men for himſelfe, yet that he maketh not that choice according to his abſolute will and power only; but know, that the Lord hath ſet apart him that is godly for himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.3. And affirmeth, that thoſe men doe turne his glory into ſhame, and do love vanity, that do affirm the contrary, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. From all theſe conſiderations herein mentioned, and many more in Scripture, we may warrantably and ſafely conclude, that neither predeſtination, election, preterition or reprobation do proceed from God upon any one man, by vertue of Gods abſolute will and power only, nor that he doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake any one man, for fore-known ſinnes, but doth continue in uſing good means, whereby all men in their well uſage thereof, might be eternally ſaved, untill that man doth give a juſt occaſion for God to forſake him, by his wilfull forſaking of God firſt perſonally, perſiſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and actually, after his inlightenment and infranchiſement.</p>

               <head>The twentieth Diſtinction ſheweth, that as all men loſt their peace with God (by <hi>Adams</hi> fall) which all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity had by propriety in him, whileſt be stood, ſo all men are vertually in Chriſt, and by Chriſt, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God againe by reſtoration, though ſome men after their inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenment, abuſe that grace of their reconciliation in him, and do thereby loſe the benefit thereof.</head>
               <p>HErein to pove that reconciliation of all men in Chriſt, we are to note, that the eternall curſe of the Law is taken away for all men, which is proved in my 4 Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>And alſo to obſerve, that Chriſts death was ſatisfactory for the tranſgreſſions, not that are, but were againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21. or Morall Law without Limitation; to prove which, it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, by being made a curſe for us, for it is written, curſed is every one that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth on the tree, Gal.</hi> 3.13. and to prove, that by the word (us) is meant all men, obſerve that that verſe is grounded upon the fore go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 8 verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>and the Scripture foreſeeing, that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpell unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham; <hi>ſaying, in thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed,</hi> according to thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited promiſes, often repeated to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that in their ſeed, no fewer than all the Nations, and all the Families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, as you may finde in <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18.3.22, 18. and 26, 4.20.14. and as that 13 <hi>verſe</hi> of <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. is immediately
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:152477:49"/>derived from that generall application in the 8 verſe preceding: So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the cauſe why Chriſt hath redeemed from the curſe of the Law, is ſhewed (in the 14 verſe, being the very next verſe following) to be this expreſly, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> (in whoſe ſeed, as before is ſhewed, that no fewer than all Nations and all Families of the earth ſhall be bleſſed) might come on the Gentiles through Jeſus Chriſt; which generall promiſe made unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> is called the Covenant, which was confirmed before in Chriſt, which the Law cannot diſanul, as appeareth plainly in the 15, 16, 17, 18 verſes next following, in the very ſame Chapter, as a concluſive confirmation of the very ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which evidently proveth, that the taking away the curſe of the Law, is ſo large for all Nations and Families of the earth, as to bring in the bleſſings in Chriſt (<hi>abrahams</hi> ſeed) over all men. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. Note alſo, by that his hanging on the tree he taſted death; and hereto the Scriputre ſhews us, that thereby and thereon, he taſted death (for no fewer than) every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. whereby his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on the tree in that Text mentioned, he become the propitiation for (no fewer ſins, than) the ſins of the whole world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. being the Tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20, 21.</p>
               <p>And as the curſe was (by his ſo being made a curſe) taken away for all men; ſo conſider, that accordingly as it is ſaid, that he is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of (no fewer than) all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. as is before diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. So alſo the Apoſtle affirmeth, that Chriſt dyed for all, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 5.15. and from that generall ground by him there laid downe, that Chriſt dyed for all; he in purſuance of the ſame diſcovery, coherently gives us to wit, in the 19 verſe next following, <hi>that God was in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes to them:</hi> Herein is cleared to open view, that by Chriſts being therein, the worlds publick man, and generall repreſentative, by hisbeing recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God in the worlds behalfe for the world; the world is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, as reconciled to God in Chriſt, verſe 18. even in him vertually; for you ſee, that by the worlds being ſo reconciled to God, and God in his juſtice and attribute of his truth, unto the world in Chriſt, the worlds treſpaſſes are not imputed to them, which hath conherent relation unto that unlimited ſpeech immediately going before, that Chriſt dyed for all; and upon the ſame ground it is affirmed, <hi>God laid upon him the iniquities of us all, Iſ.</hi> 53.6. againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:152477:50"/>
               <p> And accordingly, in the diſcovery of the reconciliation of all men in Chriſt, it is ſaid, <hi>that God had purpoſed in himſelfe, that in the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the fulneſſe of time, to gather together in one, all things in Chriſt, whether they be things in Heaven, or thing on Earth, even in him, Eph.</hi> 1.10. And further to make it to appear, that this large affirmation is ſpoken of a reconciled gathering, not only of all men who are Gods choice earthly things, as in reference to the Creation, but of all things together, in one in him, obſerve that the Apoſtle affirmeth, that it pleaſed the Father, <hi>that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, and having made peace by the blood of his Croſſe, by him to reconcile</hi> (note) <hi>by him to reconcile all things unto himſelfe,</hi> by him I ſay, <hi>whether they be things on earth, or things in Heaven, Col.</hi> 1.20.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we finde proved by Scripture, that this generall reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all men for the tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. or Convenant of works, was made to God in Chriſt, according to the good pleaſure of God will, by the blood of his Croſſe, by the ſhedding of which blood thereon, he taſted death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>But note this, that it was not for the elect, or beleevers, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians only, but for no fewer men than every man <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. or all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. not excepting any one man; and alſo he thereby became the reconciling propitiation for (no fewer ſinnes) than the ſins of the whole world, againſt the firſt Teſtament, as hath been ſaid; for this his reconciledly gathering together of all things in one, unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in Chriſt, doth unavoidably prove, that all men being his choice earthly things, are all of them, no one excepted, reconciledly to himſelfe gathered together in one in him, even in him, according to the ſaid Text, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. being compared in him vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, though ſome men wilfully through unbeleefe (after their infran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement, as in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions) will loſe the benefit of that reconciliation, perſonally; beſides, to conclude this point, all the Nations and Families of the Earth, could not be bleſſed in him, as it is proved they all are, in my next Diſtinction, except all men be as in theſe former Texts, reconciled to God in him, even in him.</p>

               <head>The one and twentieth Diſtinction proveth; that whereas all men were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved under the curſe of the Law, by the deſtrucvtive firſt <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ſo all men are againe bleſſed virtually in Chriſt, the reſtoring ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> though ſome men will, after inlightenment, voluntarily loſe the eternall benefit of that bleſſedneſſe.</head>
               <p>IN this point, though we have many proofes, yet conſidering that the Scripture uſeth the very ſame language, to confirme the ſame truth, I will only cite to your conſideration, the large extent of Gods promiſes, made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> as where he ſaith of <hi>Abraham, all the Nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him, Gen.</hi> 22.18. And againe to <hi>Iſaac, in thy ſeed ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 26.4. and as unlimitably againe to <hi>Jacob, in thy ſeed ſhall all the families of the earth be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 28.14. For as hath been proved, that Chriſt as a reall cauſe of great joy for all people, according to <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. <hi>is the Saviour of all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. as a ſaving ranſomer, or ranſoming Saviour, according to 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. and 6. <hi>verſes,</hi> compared together by a ranſoming price paid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. to recover all men, or ranſome all men, out of the impoſſibility without Chriſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to be eternally ſaved, which came over all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and to eſtate all men in the inward man, minde and will, into an ability or poſſibility in themſelves to be eternally ſaved, as is largely proved in my 2, 6, 7 Diſtinctions, which is a bleſſing far furmounting all temporall bleſſings whatſoever; therefore if we will but vouchſafe to mortifie our owne naturall inclination, to interpoſe our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, and faithfully grant as we ought to doe, that in thoſe unlimited promiſes, made to <hi>abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> that in their feed no fewer number than all the Nations, and all the Families of the earth are bleſſed.</p>
               <p>That the Holy Ghoſt doth without any myſterious mentall reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, include all men, and doth not confine ſome men to temporall bleſſings only; and alſo, that in plaine words, the Scripture ſpeaks the full and plaine truth in the litterall ſence, there will be no cauſe for me, to being any further proofe to confirme this affirmation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that the Apoſtle ſheweth us the hard conditions that be in ſuch bleſſings, which are but temporall bleſſings only ſaying, <hi>If in this life we have hope in Chriſt, we are</hi> (not only of ſome men, but) <hi>of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:152477:51"/>all men</hi> (not only miſerable, but of) <hi>all men moſt miſerable</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19.</p>
               <p>Therefore conſidering that Chriſt is a reall cauſe (not only of joy, but) of great joy (not only to ſome, but) to all people, according to the ſcope of <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10. I conceive that you will not, or dare not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, much leſſe maintaine, that theſe bleſſings proceeding by that bleſſed promiſed ſeed to all Nations, and all the Families of the earth, to be intended of God, but for temporall ends only, to any man, or ſome men, for then to thoſe men, by reaſon they are to give account for the exact proportion of quality and quanity, and time they have enjoied them.</p>
               <p>The gift of them, though from a gracious God, will in reality prove to be to thoſe men, rather an intended mentall cauſe of of aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of curſes, than reall bleſſings. But obſerve herewith, though all men be in Chriſt vertually bleſſed in their generations, yet that no man is by imputation perſonally bleſſed, untill he abide in beleeving; for though Chriſt hath taken away the eternall curſe of the Law, or firſt Teſtament, and the eternall ſting of the firſt death, as is proved he hath done, in my 4 and 5 Diſtinctions, for all or every man, and ſo reconciled all men unto God, in the attributes of his juſtice and truth, unto all men in himelfe, and ſo are all bleſſed in him, and doth inable all men in the inward man in due ſeaſon, to accept of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and abide therein in beleeving, as is proved he doth, in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions;</p>
               <p>Yet ſome men doe not, or will not accept of that great act of grace; and ſo though being delivered from the eternall curſe of the Law, or firſt Teſtament, their thoughts and actions prove to be ſinnes againſt grace, and ſo are ſinnes againſt the ſecond Covenant and by their wilfull perſiſting in that unbeliefe, they prove, and are by themſelves converted into the ſinnes againſt the Holy Ghoſt, as in my 10 and 11 Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>Thus theſe men, though having by Chriſt eſcaped the eternity of the firſt death yet do involve themſelves, into the irrevocable, eternal, curſed condition of the ſecond death; but to abiding beleevers though their faith and obedience be imperfect, and in the outward man they be ungodly, yet to the beleevers God will not impute their ſinnes, or frailties, or infirmities, though by them acted againſt Chriſt, in or under the Covenant of grace, as is proved in my 10, 14,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:152477:51"/>and 15 Diſtinctions, but covereth them, in and by Chriſt. From hence it is ſaid by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> from the Prophet <hi>David, bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſinnes are covered. Bleſſed is the man, to whom the Lordwill not impute ſinne, Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Rim.</hi> 1.8. Thus though all men are bleſſed in Chriſt from their tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt Teſtament, which unavoidably comes upon them by <hi>Adams</hi> fall by their being not imputed unto them, as in my 4, 10, and 11 Diſtinctions;</p>
               <p>Yet ſome men will, as hath been touched, by their wilfull perſiſting in unbeliefe, transforme all their actuall ſinnes, into ſinnes againſt grace, and ſo againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and thereby never obtaine a perſonall bleſſedneſſe in themſelves, by a non-imputation of thoſe their ſinnes againſt the ſecond Covenant, or covenant of grace, which they might have eſcaped, if they had well uſed their ability gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them in the common ſalvation, or bleſſed condition, where with all men are infallibly bleſſed in Chriſt vertually, as is proved not only in this, but alſo in my 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 20, 22, 23, and 24 Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

               <head>The two and twentieth Diſtinction ſheweth, that all men are by reſtoration ſanctified in Chriſt vertually, though ſome men doe abuſe the ſame, and ſo wilfully loſe the benefit of that their Sanctification.</head>
               <p>HErto note, that in our Types, <hi>Moſes</hi> with the blood of Calves and Goats, ſprinked the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.8. and he ſanctified (not only ſome, but) all the people of the Jewes, for none is excepted, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.14. which are our examples or Types, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.6, 11. Alſo note, that the bodies of thoſe beaſts that were brought in by the High Prieſt, for ſinne, were burnt without the Camp, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10, 11. therefore note here, that as all the people were ſprinkled with the blood of thoſe beaſts, not one man excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.19. that from this very ground, the Apoſtle to perfect this his diſcourſe, concerning that generall ſanctification, ſaith,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore even Jeſus, that he might ſanctifie the people with his owne blood, ſuffered without the gate, ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Thus when he ſatisfied Juſtice for the ſinnes of the people, he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red without the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but yet the queſtion may be, how many people be thereby ſanctified, by his ſo ſuffering death without
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:152477:52"/>the gate; to which queſtion the Scripture anſwers readily, ſaying he dyed for all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. and that he taſted death for (no fewer than) every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. and that thereby he became the pacifying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for the ſinnes of (no fewer people, than the ſinnes of) the whole world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. By theſe undeniable teſtimonies is proved, that our Saviour Chriſt ſanctified in himſelfe, as many people with his owne blood, by his ſuffering without the gate, as he there dyed for, which is all, or there taſted death for, which is no fewer than every man, as thoſe Texts maintaine.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that his body is the typified Temple, <hi>John</hi> 2.19, 20.21. for ſanctifying uſes to the world, as the Jewes Temple was to that whole Nation; we ought not to grudge, to give our conſent with the Scriptures, that by his ſuffering death without the gate for all men, or every man, that even ſo all men or every man, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſanctified in him, although ſome men doe prophanely abuſe that their ſanctification in him, as in the Type ſome ſanctified Prieſts, and veſſels, that were once ſanctified in the Jewiſh materiall Temple, and ſet apart for holy uſes; yet notwithſtanding, were many waies, many times ſo by them abuſed and prophaned, as that thereby, their former ſanctification was nullified.</p>
               <p>Againe, for our ſatisfaction in this very point, it is ſaid, the unbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wife is ſanctified by her beleeving husband, and alſo that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving husband, is ſanctified by his beleeving wife, whieſt they doe willingly abide together, as in the 1 of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 7.13, 16.</p>
               <p>Now beloved, can we beleeve this in the Creatures, nay even in (as conſidered of themſelves) ungodly Creatures? and will we not yield to our bleſſed unſpotted Saviour, who is not only as in the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall ſalvation, more peculiarly the head of his Church, but alſo in the common ſalvation by reſtoration, the head of (no fewer than) every man? as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. ſhal we not yield him the honour to acknowledge, that by his pretious blood-ſhed for every man, that thereby all men are ſanctified vertually in him by his reſtoration, and ſhould ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, if they after their inablement, did abide in him? as the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving wife doth not loſe the vertue of her ſanctification that ſhee hath in her beleeving husband, if ſhee depart not from him, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that our Saviour Chriſt affirmeth, ſaying, <hi>and I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me, John</hi> 12.32. not accepting any
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152477:52"/>one man, and hee draweth no man for deſtructive ends, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.56.</p>
               <p>And conſidering that not only all men, they being in reference to Creation, Gods choice earthly things, but alſo all things both in Heaven and in Earth, are not only gathered together, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciledly gathered together to himſelfe, in one in Chriſt, even in him, as you may ſee they are, by the peace made by the blood of his Croſſe, if you will be pleaſed to compare together, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15, 18, 19, 20. And even as the beleeving husband, and the beleeving wife, are in that Text exhorted, not to put away the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving wife, or unbeleeving husband, except the unbeleever doe wilfully firſt make choice to depart from the beleever; ſo chriſt put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none away from him, nor doth forſake any one man, before that perſon maketh choiſe to depart, and doth firſt actually forſake him, as is by Scripture proved in my 16 Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>But to take away all ſtumbling in this very cauſe, the Scripture very fairely ſteps forth, and plainly tels us, that there are are ſome men though by grace drawne to him, and reconciledly gathered together in one in him, as aforeſaid; yet notwithſtanding being not able eaſily to go back, will put to more ſathanicall ſtrength, and wilfully draw back even to peridition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.39. and though bought by him, do deny the Lord that bought them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. and thereby not God by preterition, but themſelves doe bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that there are ſome men, that although they are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the knowledge of the truth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. that will ſinne willingly, after they have received the knowledge of the truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. And alſo the Scripture ſheweth us, that there are ſome men, that although they be by Chriſt drawn to him, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledly gathered together in him, even in him, as before ſaid, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, will tread underfoot the Sonne of God, and although they be alſo with his blood ſanctified in him, yet will count the blood of the Covenant where with they were ſanctified (note this where with they were ſanctified) an unholy thing, and doe deſpite to the ſpirit of grace, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. which you know no man could be rightly ſaid to doe, if they were not ſo firſt bought, and ſo drawn to Chriſt, and ſo reconciledly gathered together in him, and firſt ſanctified with the blood of the Covenant in him, even before they doe deny the Lord that bought them, and before they doe account the blood of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:152477:53"/>Covenant an ungodly thing, with which ſaith the Apoſtle, if we will beleeve him, even thoſe Apoſtates were ſanctified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. then what need any further proofe in this point?</p>

               <p>Secondly, that by beleeving, ſuch beleevers are by imputation per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally juſtified, not only before God, but alſo in their own ſence and feeling, by a well grounded peace in their conſciences by faith ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

               <p>In the ſecond, ſenſe abiding beleevers are not only perſonally juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before God, by a non imputation of the worlds ſinnes, as before, but alſo by Gods imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe unto them, they are apprehenſively juſtified by the pacification of their own conſciences, by the blood of Jeſus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.3.</p>

               <p>Hereto note, that as all men loſt their righteouſneſſe, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:152477:53"/>firſt <hi>Adams</hi> fall, which all his poſterity had reſpectively in him, whileſt he ſtood, to ſhew unto us, that that great loſſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in Chriſt, the reſtoring ſecond <hi>Adam, Acts</hi> 3.21. Obſerve that in this point, it is ſaid, <hi>and he ſhall be called the Lord our righteouſneſſe, Jer.</hi> 23.6. So accordingly it is ſaid, <hi>he hath made him to be ſinne for us, who knew no ſinne, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
               <p>This is Gods end on his part in him, for all men, and to make it appeare clearly, that the expreſſions, our us, and wee, in thoſe Texts uſed, are not uſually meant of the elect or beleevers only, as ſome men doe vainly imagine, but of the world, or all men of the world. Note that this 21 verſe is naturally derived from the 19 verſe immediately going before, where it is ſaid, <hi>that God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world unto himſelfe, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,</hi> alſo that both theſe verſes doe relatively follow in his direct purſuance of his diſcovery, to confirme the largeneſſe, and effectuall extent of Chriſts dying for (no fewer than) all, as in the 14, 15 verſes preceding in the ſame Chapter, being his fundamentall foundation of that his large diſcovery.</p>
               <p>And for further proofe herein, the Apoſtle having ſhewed that by the Law, all the world became guilty before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. then from that very ground, he ſaith in the 23 verſe, <hi>all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 3.23. and 24.</p>
               <p>Now note, it is not here ſaid, all have ſinned, and the elect or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers only, or that ſome men only are juſtified, but the coherence of the Text ſaith, <hi>all have ſinned being juſt fied,</hi> but as in his ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plat he ſaid, that by the Law, all the world became guilty before God, and in this Text, that all have ſinned.</p>
               <p>So in clearing that generall guiltineſſe, he brings in that pretious antidote of Chriſts the Lambs blood, for no fewer than all, that as all have ſinned and become guilty before God, ſo all are juſtified, all have ſinned being juſtified (but ſtill) freely by his grace, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption that is in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>And you know that redemption by a price paid, by his pretious blood-ſhed, is no other in effect, but a ranſome paid. then hereto note, to ſhew the largeneſſe of redemption, that he gave himſelfe a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for (no fewer than) all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:152477:54"/>
               <p> And the genuine ſenſe of that Text, <hi>Rom</hi> 3.23. is utterly deſtroied, if we do not grant, that there are as many juſtified in him before God, by that redemption which is in Chriſt Jeſus, as have ſinned, which the Text tels us, is no fewer than all men, for ſaith the Text, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance all have ſinned, being juſtified freely by grace, from the curſe of the Law or firſt Teſtament, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 9.15. <hi>Romans</hi> 5.19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>But note further, though all men are thereby ſo juſtified in him, whether any man doe beleeve or not; yet not any man but beleevers, do perſonally injoy the comfortable uſe of the benefit thereof, neither are any imputatively juſtified in themſelves, from their ſinnes of frailty againſt grace alſo, but beleevers only.</p>
               <p>Againe, to juſtifie the truth of the juſtification of all men, by, and in Chriſt, before God, from all the aforeſaid tranſgreſſions; it is ſaid therefore, <hi>as by the offence of one, judgement came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life, Rom.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>And to make this more plain, I finde it in another reformed Bible, thus; <hi>Likewiſe then, as by the ſin of one, condemnation came on all men, even ſo by the justifying of one, commeth the righteouſneſſe that bringeth life upon all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you ſee fully proved that by Chriſt the free gift, his being given to the world, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. ſuch a juſtification proceedeth therefrom, as doth bring life upon no fewer than all men, though ſome men after their infranchiſed ability reſtored doe wilfully refuſe life and light, and do love and chooſe darkneſſe, which our Saviour ſaith, is the punctuall cauſe of condemnation, <hi>John</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>And beloved, the litterall Text maketh this truth yet more plaine, even to open view: for from the ſame ground in the ſame Chapter, as it is affirmed, that the Law entred that the offence might abound; ſo it alſo reſtifieth with this reſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But where ſinne abounded grace did much more abound, ver</hi> 20. So hereby is expreſt, that as ſinne abounded over (no fewer than) all men, as in this Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. ſo anſwerably this Text affirmeth, that grace did much more abound, where ſinne abounded; by theſe Texts compared, it is hereby proved, even in the very litte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſenſe, that as all have ſinned, even ſo grace did much more abound over all men, which is the ſame ſtill as before, only further ſtrengthned,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:152477:54"/>that all have ſinned, being juſtified freely by his grace.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why this juſtification, in and by Chriſt, is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all men, is therewith given to be this, in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>That as ſinne had reigned unto death</hi> (even over all men, ver. 12.) <hi>even ſo</hi> (largely and timely) <hi>might grace reigne through righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto eternall life, by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, ver.</hi> 21. and as it is here ſaid, that even ſo (might) grace reign. So obſerve, that it is ſaid as hath been touched, <hi>That he hath made him to be ſinne for us, that we</hi> (might) <hi>be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Note that to ſet forth how many men is meant by the word (we) it is ſaid in verſe 15. that he dyed for all, for the world, verſe 19. From thence is granted, though not that all men are made, but that all might be made in this life by beleeving (if they reſiſt not) imputatively the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in him, and might be made at the reſurrection of the body, inherently and perfectly righteous in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Note herewith, that no one of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, either had or ſhall have an inherent perſonall righteouſneſſe, either in him, by him, or from him, the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> yet by Creation it was poſſible, that they all might have proceeded from him by generation, inherently righteous, but that poſſibility being loſt by his fall, we finde that there is a reſtored poſſibility in and by Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> procured, though not that all men are made, but that by the good meanes by Chriſt performed for all men, and in due ſeaſon communicated to and in all men (according to the Text) as all men are by and in Chriſt made righteous before God, by a non-imputation of their ſinnes againſt the Law: So thereby in their well uſage of that ability given, all men might be made imputatively perſonally righteous before God, in this life time by their beleeving, and in their ſo abiding might be all made as inherently righteous, at the reſurrection of the body, as <hi>Adam</hi> was by Creation. For beloved, our Saviour Chriſt hath been, and is, but upon the work of eternall ſafety, which he hath on his part intended, and doth intend to finiſh for all, if ſo be that men do not mar them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wilfully, upon his well-forming Potters wheele of reſtoration, after ability given them to doe the contrary, as <hi>Adam</hi> did for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and all his poſterity, contrary to Gods gratious prime intent in the Creation.</p>
               <p>For conſidering that a reconciliation is by Chriſt made to God, for the ſinnes of all men, or the whole world; ſo that thereby their ſinnes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:152477:55"/>againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 20. are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them, as is fully proved in my 20 Diſtinction. This doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably prove the juſtification of all men, from all thoſe ſinnes by Chriſt before God; and from this gratious juſtification of all men by Chriſt, the tranſgreſſions againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. or the ſinnes accounted to be directly againſt the Father, as in my 9 Diſtinction, which ſinnes are called the ſinnes of the whole world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. are called the ſinnes paſt, or the ſinnes which are of God paſſed by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. and from that reconciliation made, they are called old ſinnes, from which ſome men are ſaid, through their wilfull unbeleefe to forget that they are purged, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and by that reconciliation, thoſe ſinnes are counted tranſgreſſions, not that are, but which were under the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.</p>
               <p>And from that reconciliation made, thoſe ſinnes are ſaid not to be ſinnes that doe reign, but that had reigned unto death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.21. although ſome men doe by their wilfull unbeleefe and diſobedience, though having ſo eſcaped thoſe pollutions, yet doe returne with the dog to the vomit, and with the ſow that was waſhed, to the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in the mire of tranſgreſſions againſt the ſecond Teſtament, or Covenant of grace gratiouſly prefented to all men in due ſeaſon, by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this rebellious Apoſtacy of ſome men from God, by their wilfull unbeleefe, after their inabling abidingly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, as is in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions proved that all men are in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Yet beloved we are to obſerve this ſtill, that all that doe beleeve are juſtified, not only from the curſe of the Law, and the eternall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which would have thereby ſeiſed on them by the firſt death, as all men are, whether any man do beleeve it or not, but alſo (in a further ſenſe) they are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 13.39.</p>
               <p>For the clearing of which Text, I intreat you to take notice, that notwithſtanding Chriſts ſo effectuall and timely taking away the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the curſe of the Law or firſt Teſtament, and aboliſhing the firſt death due for the tranſgreſſions againſt the covenant of workes, even for all men, as it is proved that he hath done, in my 4 and 5 Diſtinctions, from which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not juſtifie any man, ſo that no ſinnes of that nature againſt the Covenant of works, or the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152477:55"/>Fathers Covenant, written with his owne finger on Mount <hi>Sinai, Exod.</hi> 31.18. are imputed to the world, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20, 21. becauſe <hi>God hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. even us, all men, and although this remiſſion is effectually procured by Chriſt, to remaine for ever, for the benefit of all men, whether any man do beleeve, or do not beleeve the ſame: Yet notwithſtanding mens actuall ſinnes, even to an idle word, <hi>Ma.</hi> 12.36. are ever ſince Chriſts ranſoming all men by the Fathers eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and application of the vertue of his blood (as if it had been actually ſhed at <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as is ſhewed in my ninth Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on).</p>
               <p>Sinnes not againſt the Law, but againſt grace procured by Chriſt for all men, from which alſo the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot juſtifie any man, which ſinnes whileſt they remaine in any man, to be only ſins of ignorance, frailty and infirmity, as Chriſt hath purchaſed a power to himſelfe, to forgive thoſe ſinnes as Sonne of man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.16. So he hath promiſed, that verily all thoſe ſinnes ſhall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the ſonnes of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.10. even untill they prove ſinnes perſiſted in againſt the Holy Ghoſts gratious dictates, as thoſe Texts do manifeſt, for then thoſe men by thoſe ſins ſo far perſiſted in, doe totally exclude from themſelves, the benefit of the Covenant of grace, and thoſe perſons have then thereby, no relation to receive pardon by the death of Chriſt, as is fully proved in my 11 Diſtinction, for Chriſt dyed only to take away the tranſgreſſions, which were againſt the firſt Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>Romans</hi> 5.18, 19, 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Yet whileſt theſe ſinnes againſt grace, are not ſo farre perſiſted in, as is before ſaid, but do remain as <hi>Paul's</hi> ſins, and others before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightenment, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 12.17. which though indeed being ſinnes againſt the very Goſpell of grace, yet being ſinnes through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, infirmity, and frailty acted.</p>
               <p>Though the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> be much more unable to juſtifie thoſe tranſgreſſors for thoſe tranſgreſſions, yet they have been, are, and ſhal be all pardoned (as men being ſo reſtoredly inabled, as before is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that all men in due ſeaſon are) do faithfully indeavour to perform the condition annexed in the ſecond Covenant, which condition is beleevingly to confide in God and his mercy and goodneſſe in Chriſt, where the Goſpell is vouchſafed, and where it is not, to confide in his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152477:56"/>grace and goodneſſe only, as in my ninth Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the ſtrictneſſe of the Law of works, and mens apparant and abundant falling ſhort, in the performances thereto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and notwithſtanding their failings through frailty, againſt the Covenant of grace alſo; yet if they fixedly do confide in this only that God is good and gracious unto ſinners, and ungodly ones, ſtrivingly indeavouring to walk before God accordingly, they are accepted; of which goodneſſe of God, the Holy Ghoſt doth by one means or other, diſcover to every man in due ſeaſon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 9.</p>
               <p>Yet further note that this faith, though it be in beleevers, yet alſo being conſidered of, as in reference to themſelves, is defective and unworthy, yet God is pleaſed by free grace, to account them worthy, and although their works alſo are accordingly imperfect, yet he is pleaſed to impute righteouſneſſe unto them, according to his new treaty made with the world by the application of the vertue of Chriſts blood, as if it had been actually ſhed at the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as hath been ſaid and proved, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8.</p>
               <p>So by this means it appears plainly to our apprehenſion, not only how farre, and from what all men, even whileſt they doe remaine in unbeliefe, are fully and freely, by Chriſts performances, juſtified before God from all that, from which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not juſtifie them, this juſtification remaining accompliſhed for ever, for all men, whether any man doe beleeve it or not.</p>
               <p>That is to ſay, from the eternity of the curſe of the Law, and firſt death, from which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could not juſtifie them; but alſo it is hereby made manifeſt, that thoſe that doe beleeve are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only from the curſe of the Law, and danger of the firſt death, which was due for the tranſgressions againſt that Law of firſt Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is proved all men are, in my 4 and 5 Diſtinctions; but alſo abiding beleevers, according to that Text, 3.39. are juſtified alſo from all (other) things or offences which never were, or are nor can be puniſhable by that Morall Law or Covenant of works, called here the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither could, nor can, nor ſhall the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> juſtifie them, from thoſe offences in any meaſure: Yet as is ſaid, the obedient humble beleevers, are with <hi>Paul</hi> and others, juſtified by grace even from their failings, by ignorance, frailty, or infirmity paſt, preſent, or to come, by them ſo acted againſt the Covenant of grace alſo.</p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:152477:56"/>
               <p> But this juſtification is peculiar to beleevers only, in the ſpeciall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, expreſly ſo accounted of, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</p>
               <p>And the generall juſtification of all men by Chriſts performances, from the eternity of the curſe of the Law and firſt death, are gratious effects iſſuing from the common ſalvation mentioned, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. and accompliſhed by Chriſt for all men, who by removing of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to be eternally ſaved, which came over all men by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, is the Saviour of all men, and ſo ſtiled in the ſame verſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. Yet even the humble obedient beleevers, though being by faith ſo juſtified before God, and by grace imputed and counted juſt men before God, yet even they muſt live by faith, by the forſaking all ſelfe-conceited juſtification, which ſheweth us the meaning of that place, where it is ſaid, <hi>that even the juſt</hi> (man) <hi>ſhall live by his faith, Hab.</hi> 2.4. which is alſo affirmed in <hi>Rom</hi> 4.5.</p>

               <p>And you know, that before <hi>Adams</hi> fall, no man had ſinned, nor actually forſaken him, ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf and all his poſterity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively in him, were all then overcommers in Gods eſtimation.

               <p>Thus we find that the ſpirituall book of life, pertaining to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the firſt Teſtament, eſtabliſhed by God, as appertaining to the very act of Creation, was by the ſhall of <hi>Adam</hi> into ſinne and rebellion, utterly nullified, ſo that all men by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſaid, were blotted out of the ſame.</p>

               <p>Thus Chriſt, who is the everlaſting Father, and Prince of peace, <hi>is the light of the world, John</hi> 8.12. <hi>and the truth and the life, John</hi> 4.6. <hi>the infranchiſing reſtoring Adam, Acts</hi> 3.21. who ſwalloweth up the firſt death in victory, as is fully proved in my 5 Diſtinction, by that means he did bring in a reſtored life and immortality to light, through the Goſpell, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. whereby appeareth why it is peculiarly fixed on him, that in him we live, and move, and have our being, which is not that condition of life, which came in by Creation, for in that reſpect, its ſaid, <hi>In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth,</hi> and in the plurall number, <hi>let us make man,</hi> in hiding the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. that life and being was to have ſtood by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience to the Law of works; but that bleſſed firſt life inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for mankinde, being nulled by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> for all men, then this Goſpell-reſtored living, moving, and being of all men, as you ſee is appropriated to him our Lord Chriſt, and his reſtoration, <hi>for all power is given unto him, in Heaven and in Earth, Mat.</hi> 28.18. who in reſtored immortall life, at the finall reſurrection, will fully take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of all men, good and bad, beleevers and unbeleevers, though
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:152477:58"/>wilfull unbeleevers will turne the bleſſedneſſe of that immortall life, formerly intended for them, into a curſe, as appeareth by thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſentences pronounced concerning all men, where it is ſaid, <hi>when the Sonne of Man ſhall come in his glory, come yee bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and depart from me yee curſed, into everlasting fire, Mat.</hi> 25.31, 34, 41. which ſaying fully proveth the immortality of that curſed life, which is called the ſecond death; and although ſome men doe thus wilfully periſh in the ſecond death, though being by Chriſt and his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, perfectly delivered from the firſt death, yet wee finde, as is before proved, that life and immortality is brought againe to light through the Goſpell, by his reſtoration from the firſt death for and to all men, to ſecure not only thoſe Apoſtates, but all men from peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in that griſly curſed condition of the firſt death, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would have been eternall to all.</p>
               <p>By which means accompliſhed by Chriſt the everlaſting Father, and Prince of peace, for all men, the reſtored book of life, wherein all men were then againe (according to Scripture-language) written, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world; for from this very ground, as I finde ſaid, the free gift came upon (no fewer than) all men unto juſtification of life, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. So alſo I finde it thus, <hi>verbatim,</hi> in ſome reformed Bibles, ſaid, <hi>Likewiſe then as by the ſinne of one, condemnation came on all men, even ſo by the juſtifying of one, commeth the righteouſneſſe that bringeth life upon all men, Rom.</hi> 5.18.</p>
               <p>Thus the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation unto (no leſſe number than) all men, hath appeared, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. And hereby we find that there is a reſtored book of life brought into the world, by and with Chriſt the free gift, his being given to the world, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. wherein by him and his coſtly gratious means uſed, all men, were againe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and alſo accordingly, we finde God gratiouſly appearing to the world againe, with this reſtored book of life, by <hi>Moſes</hi> his deſiring of God for the preſervation of the Jewiſh Nation, ſaying, <hi>blot me out of the book that thou haſt written, Exod.</hi> 32.32.</p>
               <p>Alſo there is expreſſe mention made of his book of life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.28. but we need no further in this cauſe to traverſe thoſe records; for as hath been ſomewhat touched, ſo more fully to ſatisfie the world in this very point, it is plainly ſaid, <hi>he that overcommeth I will not blot his name out of the book of life, Rev.</hi> 3.5.</p>
               <p>Is not this a cleare teſtimony of Scripture to maintain this canſe?
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:152477:58"/>we cannot ſhut our internall eyes ſo cloſe, if we be but rationall men, but that we muſt needs know hereby, conſidering the book of life, which came in by Creation, was extinguiſhed by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, that even thoſe mens names which do not overcome, were once again written in this book of life, that came in by Chriſts reſtoration, for elſe how is it poſſible that their names ſhould or could be blotted out of the book of life, for their not overcomming?</p>
               <p>But as you ſee that this is proved in the negative, ſo for further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, behold the ſame truth alſo confirmed in the affirmative, where in Scripture it is ſaid, <hi>If any man ſhall take away from the words of the book of this prophecie, God ſhall take away his part out of the book of life, Rev.</hi> 22.19. Hereby we are inforced to grant that even ſuch of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders have a part in the book of life, untill it be taken away, even out of that book of life for their offence. For you know thoſe offenders parts cannot be taken away out of the book of life, if even thoſe ſo tranſgreſſing men, had not formerly a part even in the book of life.</p>
               <p>And whereas at the laſt great judgement, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.11, 12. there is mention made of books opened, in the plurall number: Theſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold books may be fitly underſtood to be every particular mans book of his own conſcience; and whereas it is ſaid, another book was opened (in the ſingular number) which is the book of life; from hence it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that thoſe books of the ſecrets of every particular mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (their conſciences bearing witneſſe, and their thoughts accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or elſe excuſing one another, according to <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.) ſhall be then and there opened together with that one book of life, in the daies of that great judgement aforeſaid, or in the <hi>day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men, according to the Goſpell, ver.</hi> 16. whereby will manifeſtly appeare, as it were by a true paire of tallies, that there is no more mens names cut off from that tally, nor blotted out of Gods book of life, then that the book or tally of their owne Conſciences, being comparedly put together to that tally of Gods book of life, ſhall clearly make manifeſt, that God hath not blotted out any one mans name out of his book of life, nor taken away any one mans part out of that book, but only the names and parts of ſuch men, as have firſt on their parts perſonally and actually given a juſt occaſion for God to deale ſo with them; the books of every mans conſcience then and thereto clearly juſtifying God in all his proceedings. And from theſe Scripture-diſcoveries aforeſaid, being conſidered of together, it appears
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:152477:59"/>plainly, that the Lambs book of life, alſo mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.8, 21, 27. and 10.15. is compoſed of thoſe, and only of thoſe over-commers names, which are then found written in that book of life not blotted out; this the Lambs book of life is the book of remembrance, which by that means proveth the book wherein Gods jewels are recorded, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16, 17.</p>
               <p>But how far this Scripture-modell (of the diſcovery of the common ſalvation) in this tract ſet forth to view, doth vindicate the glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our gratious God, in all his holy attributes united. How it preſenteth the amiable conſent and concord of Scripture, agreeing and declaring it ſelfe by it ſelfe, with out humane gloſſing or interpretation, or jarring with it ſelfe, as ſome men would enforce it to doe, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing humane art.</p>
               <p>And by proving the extent of the common ſalvation, how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, faire, comfortable, and ſure foundation is thereby rendered in Chriſt, for all diſtreſſed conſciences to procure repentance, and to build their faith and hope upon, as upon a rock, or the ſure word of propheſie, untill the day dawn; and the day-ſtar ariſe in their hearts; in the mean time by their patient waiting for their eſtabliſhing in the ſpeciall ſalvation, depending on the comfortable generall promiſes, proceeding from God in a common ſalvation expreſſed in his written word; when as on the contrary, all rotten ſandie foundations of faith, built up upon mens altered qualifications, or legall reformations, doe either beget doubting with unſatisfied unbeleeving <hi>Thomas,</hi> concerning the extent, and gratious effects of Chriſts actuall death, and perſonall reſurrection, eſpecially as in relation to their own eternall happineſſe: or elſe for want of their election, being diſcovered to them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſupernaturally confirming their acceptation with God to eternall life, they do either drown themſelves in ſuperſtition, or elſe they doe deſperately caſt themſelves headlong into a dangerous untimely death.</p>
               <p>How far this tract by proving the infranchiſement, or ſetting free of all mens wils in the inward man, minde and will, in due ſeaſon doth take away from men, the occaſion of theſe and ſuch like blaſphemous ſpeeches, by their ſaying, or at leaſt in their ſecret thoughts, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus, or in the like manner; if God doe beſtow the ability to repent and beleeve, but upon a few men, and hath decreed according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who be thoſe perſons, as I am by ſome learned men taught:</p>
               <p>Then why ſhould I waſt my ſelfe with melancholy diſpute, about my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:152477:59"/>acceptation with him; for if I be elected, then how careleſſe ſoever I be on my part, yet I ſhall be ſaved; and if I be reprobated, then how induſtrious ſoever I am for ſafety, yet I ſhall be damned, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould I ſtrive for my ſalvation, as if I could and would alter or hinder Gods decree?</p>
               <p>To prevent which evils; how farre the beliefe of this Scripture-modell, concerning the infranchiſement of the wils of all men in due ſeaſon, will inable all men experimentally to confeſſe to the glory of God, and mens own ſhame, that the fault is not in the ſuppoſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition of God, as ſome men imagine, but in themſelves, in that they will not repent, and in that though they being by God inabled thereto, yet will not beleeve or be obedient, whereas otherwiſe by their being taught, that God decreedly withholdeth ſaving means from ſome men, they are ready to make advantage of that deſperate doctrine, and to ſatisfie carnall affections, to lay the fault on God and his partiality, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that they cannot repent, and that by the operation of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, they cannot beleeve, and ſo become careleſly deſperate.</p>
               <p>And although indeed this tract doth by Scripture maintaine, that no one meer man, hath freedome of will ſo much, as to think one good thought, much leſſe to act in the leaſt meaſure, as ſavingly acceptable to God, no not by imputation, as he is naturally deſcended from pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Adams</hi> loins; Yet how firmely this tract proveth by Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Proteſtant tenent (who do limit the ability given of God but to ſome men) that God doth by the grace of the generall propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, mentioned 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. effectually ſet free every man in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, minde and will in due ſeaſon, ſo that no one man ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh eternally by Gods preterition, for fore-ſeen ſinners, before act; as ſome men have vainly imagined, that ſome men as meer Creatures, or for foreſeen ſins, do by Gods eternall reprobation or preterition, but only through his own perſonall default, actually committed after his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightenment and infranchiſement.</p>
               <p>From hence how far God is hereby glorified and juſtified, in all his promiſes, threatnings, rewards and puniſhments, exhortations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, being frequently ſpoken to all men for them themſelves to do, or leave undone, who will have by Chriſt in due ſeaſon, their wils and apprehenſions freed, as is by Scripture proved in my 6 and 7 Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, ſo that thereby they are inabled ſpiritually to heare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and feare, and love, and be obedient to the faith.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:152477:60"/>
               <p> How far this tract diſcovereth, what fallacious ſcholaſticall ſhifts, ſome erroneous Proteſtants are in many conſiderable Scripture points, inforced to uſe, by reaſon of their not being guided by the litterall ſenſe of the plaine Texts of Scripture, which doe unanimouſly confirm the common ſalvation or infranchiſement of all men in the inward man in due ſeaſon, and that thereby ſome of them have and doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that God did by decree by his abſolute will and power only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſome part of mankinde, without any reſpect by him had, to their doing evill, merely as Creatures, without any cauſe done, or fore-ſeen to be done on the creatures part. Thus they charging God contrary to his own word; with palpable tyrannicall partiality, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, or elſe with ſome other Proteſtants, that dare not ſtand to that horrid and hideous affirmation, do ſay that God did not ſo tyrannically reprobate any man: But they thinking to moderate the buſineſſe, yet by being deluded alſo by humane art, do as fallaciouſly maintaine, that God fore-knowing all men fallen into <hi>Adams</hi> ſinning, did only by preterition paſſe by ſome men, ſo as decreedly they ſhould not have any ſuch means uſed with them, whereby they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in their good uſe thereof, to obtaine eternall life, but that ſome men of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, muſt upon neceſſity eternally periſh, though it then could not be in their own actuall ſinnes, yet in thoſe ſins which unavoidably, as a violent irreſiſtible inundation, overwhelmed them originally by another mans offence, to which ſins they never actually conſented, and to which tranſgreſſions, they much leſſe perſonally acted it being committed by <hi>Adam,</hi> before they had a being, or before they were born. They by that means rendering our good God, who is a faithfull Creator, unfaithfully forſaking ſome men of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, even whileſt they were, as concerning their own perſonall conſent, or act, innocent Creatures, and alſo before they were after the fall inabled to depend on him, and alſo before they had actually or perſonally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him; which tenent is proved by Scriptures to be abſolutely falſe, in my 16 and 17 Diſtinctions, which preterition by them imagined, if you doe but view the intrals of it, you ſhall finde it to bee in effect, no other than a diſguiſed, or maſqued tyrannicall decreed reprobation; for as hath been ſaid, he that hath power, and doth keep from a man his ſood of lively-hood, may as really kill that man ſo, as if he cut off his head with a ſword.</p>
               <p>How far this tract doth detect the error that is in the proteſtant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:152477:60"/>concerning Chriſts giving himſelfe a ranſome for all men, by their affirming, that Chriſt doth not effectually ranſome any man, except that man be eternally ſaved, which fallacy is ripped open to view, in my 2, 6 and 7 Diſtinctions, wherein is proved, that Chriſt doth effectually ranſome all men, and ſave all men, from the impoſſibility to be eternally ſaved, that came over all by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and eſtates them by himſelfe, with a poſſibility in themſelves to be eternally ſaved.</p>
               <p>How far alſo (though not medling with the impertinent tradition of popery) this tract doth ſhew plainly, that the many hereticall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Papiſts, upon which the whole rabble of their falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive doctrine, and fantaſticall ceremoniall diſcipline, doth depend, was hatched, and is nurſed by their not making uſe of the large and true Scripture extent of the common ſalvation of all men, in ſetting free all men in due ſeaſon, in the inward man, minde and will, by free grace, ſo that in their well uſage of that meanes, they might beleeve and might be eternally ſaved; for by the Papiſts caſting away this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-truth, confirming the gratious ſetting free of all mens (by the fall) diabollically captived wils, they do fallaciouſly affirm, that man hath free will by nature, or by originall deſcent from <hi>Adams</hi> loines, which naturall freedome of will, by its conſenting to good, is the diſpoſing cauſe of our juſtificarion.</p>
               <p>For as I finde recorded, they ſay, that works <hi>Congruo,</hi> are the diſpoſing cauſe of our juſtification,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Andrad.</hi> in Conc. Trid. Seſ. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> which as they ſay is of mens ſelves, and ſtandeth of the aſſent of mens wils and reaſon, and this faith ſay they is Catholike and perfect, but yet unformed, and as ſoon as works are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to joined they call it formed, and then ſay they it is meritorious, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne, and juſtifieth; for ſay they, we are juſtified by faith and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity together, as the diſpoſing cauſe of our juſtification as a neceſſary cauſe to obtaine at Gods hand, the grace of juſtification, but rather by charity,<note place="margin">Conc. Trid. Seſ. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> than by faith, becauſe ſay they, that charity goeth before our juſtification, as a neceſſary cauſe to obtaine at Gods hand, the grace of our juſtification, and adoption of his children. Thus by the Papiſts rejecting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-teſtimony, concerning the ſetting free all mens wils by free grace, by Chriſt procured in the common ſalvation, as is proved in my 6 and 7 Diſtinctions, they are ſo wildred an deluded, that they doe heretically appropriate the diſpoſing power; to act, meritoriouſly well
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:152477:61"/>unto mens well acting in the freedome of their natural wils.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc.</hi> 6.9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe the Scripture doth maintain ſo ſtrongly, that no mere man hath freedome of his will by nature, and that as in the tract is proved, that no mere man whatſoever, no not <hi>Adam</hi> if he had ſtood in his eſtate of innocency; much leſſe any beleever, who are all as concerning themſelves, defective, cannot, nor could not have the leaſt footſtep at any time, in any one thing, to challenge the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as due of debt to them, from their Creators hand, otherwiſe than he by whom they are, what they are, and from whom they have received whatſoever good they have, is pleaſed according to his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made by his owne free grace, to account them worthy, and that though all beleevers are not in themſelves in this life righteous, yet by Chriſt to impute righteouſneſſe unto them that doe beleeve in him, that juſtifieth the ungodly. But this Scripture-truth is ſo mortally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to their fancied meritorious life with God, that rather then they will lay down their boſome-imbraced deluſions, and humane tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they will venture at one ſtroke deſperately to hazard to deface the Holy writ it ſelfe; and as I find recorded, that ſome of their deceived Grandees, have thruſt into the world, this blaſphemous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that the written Goſpell is but as a noſe of was,<note place="margin">Vita Pont.</note> which may be ſet or turned divers waies, as it beſt pleaſeth the humours of men, that ſteer the courſe for their doctrine and diſcipline, or as ſome of them have ſaid, the written Goſpell is but a fable of ſmall profit.</p>
               <p>But how far and how clearly this aforeſaid tract, doth confute theſe, and many ſuch like errors, both ſchiſmaticall, and hereticall, and ſteps in to put an end to frivolous and fruitleſſe contentions, I leave to the judgement of any man, who will vouchſafe to give this ſhort Scripture-modell, a conſiderate peruſall, and doth not ſhrink or draw backe from the averment of the truth, which is infallibly by one gratious meanes or other (in due ſeaſon according to the will of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4, 6.) brought to the knowledge of every man; and thus I doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe my 24 Diſtinſtions, for the diſcovery of the effectual extent of the common ſalvation; <hi>And the Temple was open in Heaven, and the four and twenty Elders which ſate before God on their ſeats, fell upon their faces, and worſhipped God, and caſt their Crowns before the throne, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Thou art worthy Lord to receive glory, and honour, and power, Rev.</hi> 5.11, 14. and <hi>the</hi> 11.16, 19. And accordingly, that God in Chriſt may
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:152477:61"/>be truly glorified by his word, and in all his holy attributes united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to the great increaſe of mankinds cordiall love, and faith full obedience to God, and mens augmented comfort in Gods abundant grace, teſtified in mankinds Jubilee, is the daily prayers of me, his unworthy Inſtrument, and thine officious ſervant, by, and under the protection and direction of Jeſus Chriſt our eternall bleſſed Lord, the everlaſting father, and Prince of Peace.</p>

               <p>HEreto I pray you be pleaſed to take notice, that in the diſcovery of the wonderfull myſterious conjunction of the Jubilees, with ſome remarkable paſſages of Gods gratious dealing with all men by Chriſt. As I find by ancient acute Chronology, that the firſt Judaicall Jubilee, or the firſt year of their Jubilaicall generall redemption, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any price paid for their imbondaged, either in reſpect of Perſons, Lands or Good, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. did fall in juſt upon the 50 Jubilee of the world, counting 50 years for every Jubilee, from the Creation thereof; for that firſt Jubilee of the Jewes, fell in, as I doe find it, upon the 2500 year aſter the Creation, ſo being not a Jubilee of 50 years, as the Jewes Jubilee was, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.10, 11. but a Jubilee of 50 times 50 years, for 2500 yeares, containes 50 times 50 years; ſo that thereby it appears, that the firſt year of the Jewes Jubilee, fell in upon a Jubilee, which was a Jubilee compoſed of 50 Jubilees, counting 50 yeares for every Jubilee, from the Creation from thence being a Jubilee of Jubilees.</p>
               <p>And alſo as I finde, that the 30 Judaicall Jubilee, did fall in juſt with the 30 year of Chriſts age about which time he began to preach, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Luke</hi> 3.28. with 4.17, 22. Even ſo it proveth by providence (not though of by me, untill after I had intituled this Treatiſe, <hi>Mankind's Jubilee</hi>) that this former diſcovery of the extent of the common ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Mankind's Jubilee, or good tidings of great joy for all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, did fall in upon the 33 Jubilee, being counted 50 years for every Jubilee, from our Saviour Chriſts birth; which number of 33 Jubilees being expired in the Jubilaicall year, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:152477:62"/>in ſuch manner, and to ſuch reall ends for all men, as is diſcovered in this former tract.
